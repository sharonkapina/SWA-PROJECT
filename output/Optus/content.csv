This is the foundation for our belief that there is no place for modern slavery in our world.  We know that working together with our suppliers on modern slavery and broader human rights  issues is key to achieving a more sustainable future and we are committed to being transparent  and sharing the meaningful progress we have made. During the year, we enhanced our approach to  managing modern slavery risks as set out in this Statement, including taking steps to strengthen  our engagement with our suppliers through our new Supplier Engagement Roadmap. We have also  integrated key recommendations from our Supplier Engagement Roadmap into our Modern Slavery  Action Plan. Across our business, we are committed to continuous improvement, learning along the way, and  strengthening our engagement with suppliers to address ongoing challenges around modern slavery.  While we had no reported instances of modern slavery relating to our operations or supply chain  during the reporting period, we understand this does not mean no risks exist.  We look forward to building on our response over the coming year. This includes enhancing  our modern slavery contract clauses, providing additional targeted internal training, exploring  opportunities to deepen our engagement with high-risk suppliers and considering scope for social  audits for our suppliers.   We are also monitoring the Australian Government’s response to the independent review of the  MSA to help ensure we are prepared to respond to any potential changes to the legislation and  Government’s expectations.  We hope you find this Statement informative and as always, we welcome your feedback. Michael Venter, Interim Chief Executive Officer Overview 6 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 7 =====  3	 This definition of modern slavery is taken from the Australian Government’s  official guidance material about the MSA. Introduction All businesses have an important role to play in combating modern slavery in global  supply chains, including in the telecommunications sector. Our work to assess and  address modern slavery risks in our operations and supply chain is a key element of our  commitment to respect all internationally recognised human rights in line with the   UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). As a leading Australian telecommunications provider, we are committed to ensuring  there is no place for modern slavery in our operations or supply chain. We have been a  signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2007, which includes a focus on eliminating  forced and compulsory labour and child labour. We are also proud to support the 2030  UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with one of our priority SDGs including Goal  8: decent work and economic growth. Importantly, Goal 8 includes a strong focus on  taking action to help end modern slavery. What is Modern Slavery? Modern slavery occurs when ‘coercion, threats or deception are used to exploit victims and  undermine or deprive them of their freedom.’3 Modern slavery involves serious human rights abuses  and can happen here in Australia, as well as overseas. The International Labour Organization (ILO)  and Walk Free Foundation estimate that over 50 million people around the world are victims of  modern slavery. According to new 2024 ILO estimates, the illegal profits from this exploitation  amount to US$236 billion. The Walk Free Foundation also estimates there may be up to 41,000  modern slavery victims in Australia and that electronics are one of Australia’s ‘top five imported  products at risk of modern slavery’.    Overview 7 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 8 ===== In our last statement, we committed to: We have progressed this commitment by:  Implementing our Supplier Engagement Roadmap and  commencing detailed reviews of key suppliers in high-risk  sectors to better understand their operations and supply  chains, potential risks and mitigation strategies Finalising our Supplier Engagement Roadmap and identifying priority recommendations for action  during the reporting period to enable us to better understand our modern slavery risks in our supply  chain and opportunities to enhance our risk management in these areas. This included a detailed review  of a selected own brand supplier with further reviews planned for the next reporting period.  Refining formal indicators to support us to monitor and  report on the effectiveness of our response Continuing to consider the scope to enhance our effectiveness indicators, including benchmarking the  quality of our modern slavery reporting, including in this area, against a selected peer. Moving forward,  we will also consider how we can monitor the effectiveness of new actions implemented as part of our  Supplier Engagement Roadmap.   Reviewing our procurement and Request for Proposal  (RFP) process to include assessment of modern slavery  risk management Reviewing key procurement and RFP processes as part of our Supplier Engagement Roadmap and  commencing implementation of actions to refine our approach in these areas, including new modern  slavery tender questions. We also piloted tailored modern slavery tender questions in a high-risk  supplier category during the reporting period. This helped inform our decision making on appropriate  vendors. Undertaking an assessment of our whistleblower  mechanism in line with the effectiveness criteria in the  UNGPs  We continue to benchmark our whistleblower process annually against good practice and legislative  requirements (noting that this benchmarking review focuses on the overall functioning of the  whistleblower mechanism and is not specific to modern slavery). To inform our consideration of next  steps, we also specifically benchmarked the quality of our modern slavery reporting, including in relation  to grievance mechanisms and reporting, against a selected peer. We subsequently commenced a high- level assessment of our whistleblower mechanism in line with the effectiveness criteria in the UNGPs  and will report on this work in the next statement for FY25. Providing additional tailored modern slavery training  targeted to selected Optus staff involved in managing  key supplier relationships  Delivered a general modern slavery awareness-raising session to representatives from Optus  Procurement in June 2023. We will also provide an additional training session for relevant category and  vendor managers in FY25, which will be reported on in the next statement. Our progress   to date Continuous improvement  is core to our modern  slavery response and we  aim to be transparent  about our goals and  progress.  We are working to  further refine our  modern slavery risk  management across a  range of areas. Overview 8 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Our future plans  We are also working to identify ways  we can further strengthen our ongoing  response to modern slavery.  Overview Over the next reporting period, we aim to prioritise:  •	 Engaging with selected higher risk suppliers, including relevant Own  Brand suppliers, through detailed reviews to assess their modern  slavery risk management. •	 Delivering tailored training to relevant vendor and category  managers to support them to better manage modern slavery risks  through their engagement with suppliers. •	 Implementing enhanced modern slavery contract clauses with  selected suppliers. •	 Implementing modern slavery tender questions for higher risk  suppliers and using the results to inform our understanding of risk  areas and approach to risk management. •	 Considering scope to implement social audits for selected suppliers.  •	 Supporting the development of the Singtel Group Responsible  Procurement Policy and strengthening our suppliers’ understanding  of our human rights and modern slavery requirements.    9 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Our structure,  operations and  supply chain 1. 10 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 11 ===== We are Australia’s second largest provider of telecommunications services, providing customers with over 11 million  services across Australia each day, and understand the important role we play in tackling modern slavery. 1. Our structure, operations and supply chain Our structure Optus is part of the Singtel Group, Asia’s leading communications technology company that, through  its associates, has a combined 770 million mobile customers across 21 countries. Optus operates as  a corporate group comprised of over 40 entities. In addition to the customer-facing entities listed in  Appendix 2 that provide telecommunications, content and other services, Optus also operates subsidiaries  that provide support services for our operations, including engaging Optus staff and performing  management and billing services.   Optus is headquartered in Macquarie Park, New South Wales, and we have offices and retail outlets  across all states and territories of Australia, employing more than 6,700 people. Key functions across  our business relevant to our modern slavery response include Networks, Enterprise and Business, People  and Culture (including Group Sustainability), Risk Management, Group Finance (including Legal and  Procurement), Internal Audit, Customer Success (Retail and Customer Contact Centres) and Customer  Solutions (Operations and Enablement). Our operations We deliver a comprehensive range of telecommunications products and services, including mobile and  fixed line telephone, fixed and mobile broadband services, multimedia entertainment and technology,  and converged business telecommunications and applications and solutions to small and medium sized  businesses, enterprise and government customers.  Optus is also Australia’s largest and most experienced satellite owner and operator, with five satellites  currently in orbit providing satellite services across Australia and New Zealand and to McMurdo Sound in  the Antarctic.  Our nationwide retail network operating under the Optus brand includes proprietary, franchisee, and  licensee stores. Optus stores are in 275 locations to provide Australians with easy access to high quality  telecommunications services and solutions.  We also service the telecommunications market through our wholesale business, which sells access to our  communications network to other telecommunications service providers. In addition, we have agreements  with business partners overseas who provide roaming services to our customers travelling outside  Australia. In some cases, these roaming services are provided by other entities in the Singtel Group. 11 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 12 ===== We have a large and diverse global supplier base with over 1,300 direct suppliers. Approximately 95% of our procurement spend in the reporting period was in the following categories: Our customers: We support individual and enterprise customers around Australia. 98.5% of the Australian population is covered by our 4G and 5G networks.  We are a fully integrated telecommunications provider. We have over 275 Optus stores (approximately two-thirds managed by partner groups) Our operations: Our services: Local, long distance and  international, mobile and  fixed line voice Broadband Multimedia entertainment  and technology services Satellite  services Converged business  telecommunications  applications and solutions Our people: 6,700+  team members 400+ contingent* workers  within our Australian operations Our supply chain Network and Equipment Technology  Professional Services Building and  Construction Professional  Services IT and  Equipment Contact Centres Such as equipment to  power Optus Network  infrastructure  including 5G and  satellite infrastructure Such as partners  supporting and  delivering IT projects  and programs Such as infrastructure  investments, including  our retail footprint Such as strategic and  consultancy services Such as IT and  equipment used in  offices and retail  stores Including contracted  workers to support  our customers Such as online and  offline advertising Media and  Marketing Mobile Devices Such as mobile  phones and tablets  for our customers and  employees, wearable  devices and equipment  installed at sites 1.

We recognise that this is  not necessarily the country  where the product or service is  manufactured or sourced from,  and we are undertaking work  to better understand our supply  chain beyond Tier 1. Our supply chain We draw on our global  supply chain to support our  operations.  The majority of supplier identification, evaluation and  engagement is facilitated by Optus Procurement. Our  centralised Procurement team supports the business to  undertake transparent and effective sourcing processes,  identify and implement risk mitigation, assess supplier  practices and align commercial and business goals with  Optus’ values and public commitments. During the  reporting period, the dedicated Supplier Management  Centre of Excellence team acted as internal advisors  to the procurement team and broader Optus business  to meet minimum standards and ongoing supplier  performance management and monitoring, in parallel  working to simplify the supplier experience supporting  Optus. More information about our Procurement team  and our work to further enhance our procurement  frameworks is set out on page 28.  Where are our suppliers located? While approximately 83% of our 1,300+ suppliers are  located in Australia, many of these may operate in or  source from diverse countries overseas. Levels of modern  slavery risk across these countries may vary, including  due to factors such as conflict and displacement and the  effectiveness of local legal frameworks.

The different categories we source  goods and services from may also  involve different levels of modern  slavery risk.  As shown in the visual on the right, a significant proportion  of our supplier spend is for mobile devices as well as network  and equipment. However, while our spend in some categories  such as devices is concentrated across a small number of  suppliers, our spend in other categories like professional  services can involve a higher number of suppliers. The size  of our suppliers can also vary significantly within and across  categories.  These factors mean that the capacity of our suppliers to  manage modern slavery risks is not uniform and can also  affect our ability to use our leverage to influence supplier  practices. For example, although we have significant spend  with our electronic devices suppliers, the size of these  businesses means we may have limited leverage to influence  how they manage their modern slavery risks. The visual to the  right shows information about our supplier spend based on  annual goods receipts by category. 1.

In some cases, the most  significant modern slavery risks in these  supply chains can occur below the Tier 1  level (the suppliers with which we have  a direct contractual relationship). This  means it is important that we work to  understand the types of activities that  may occur across our full supply chain,  including below Tier 1 level.  The visual to the right explains the key  components of selected supply chains  relevant to Optus at an indicative level.  This visual is intended as a guide to show  the different tiers that may be involved  in supply chains and does not show every  element of the relevant supply chains.

As part of this  commitment, we work  to assess and address  modern slavery risks  throughout our operations  and supply chain. 2. Identifying our modern slavery risks How we apply the UN Guiding Principles on Business  and Human Rights (UNGPs) to understand how  telecommunications companies could be involved in  modern slavery risks In line with the UNGPs and the Australian Government’s guidance about  the MSA, we understand modern slavery risks to refer to the potential for  a business to cause, contribute to, or be directly linked to modern slavery  through its products, operations or services by its business relationships.  The table on page 18 summarises how this ‘cause, contribute, directly  linked’ continuum of involvement is relevant to the telecommunications  sector.  This continuum of involvement is important as it helps identify the  different ways that telecommunications companies could be involved in  modern slavery. We have also drawn on the continuum of involvement  to inform our Modern Slavery Incident Response Plan, which provides  guidance on how we would seek to remediate modern slavery harm in line  with the UNGPs expectations. 17 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 18 ===== 2. Identifying our modern slavery risks The UNGPs and the continuum of involvement Potential modern slavery risks in the telecommunications industry Cause A business may cause modern slavery if its  actions directly result in modern slavery  practices occurring. Telecommunications companies could potentially cause modern slavery by, for example, employing young workers who are potentially  subjected to hazardous work or otherwise exploited.  Optus employs a limited number of young workers under the age of 18. Where employed - these young people perform work in our  retail stores. Optus has a practice of ensuring that all employees are at least 16 years of age to ensure that Optus complies with child  employment laws.  In addition, where young workers are engaged, they are paid at the adult rate of pay under the Optus Retail Agreement  2023 and their conditions of work are defined by this enterprise agreement which also limits the number of hours of work and prescribes  breaks between shifts and overtime. Contribute A business may contribute to modern slavery  if its actions or omissions facilitate, enable or  incentivise modern slavery practices to occur. Telecommunications companies could potentially contribute to modern slavery in a number of ways. For example, this could include where  the company disregards credible evidence that a supplier is engaged in modern slavery (for example in an audit report) and does not take  any steps to address the exploitation.  As outlined in this statement, we work to manage modern slavery risks in our supply chain. More information on these steps can be found  on page 20. Directly Linked A business may be directly linked to modern  slavery where it is connected to modern slavery  through its products, services or operations  (including where there is no direct contractual  relationship). Telecommunications companies could potentially be directly linked to modern slavery if exploitation occurs in their supply chains. For  example, goods such as mobile devices could be procured from a supplier which produces the devices at third party factories, which use  raw materials that are produced through forced labour.  We take a number of steps to manage these risks, including working to enhance our engagement with suppliers to understand their  extended supply chains and risk management approaches. More information about our work with suppliers can be found on page 32. How we apply the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  (UNGPs) to understand how telecommunications companies could be  involved in modern slavery risks (continued)  18 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 19 ===== Our salient human   rights issues Our commitment to respect  human rights applies not  only to modern slavery,  but to all internationally  recognised human rights.  In particular, for our sector,  relevant human rights that  we may impact include the  human rights to privacy;  to a clean, healthy and  sustainable environment;  and children’s rights.  We have identified our six salient human rights  issues, which are the areas where the most  severe actual or potential human rights impacts  could occur through Optus’ activities or business  relationships. Severity in this context is understood  through the lens of risk to people, rather than risk   to our business.  2. Identifying our modern slavery risks Respecting privacy  and data security Safeguarding  our environment Modern slavery is often closely connected to other human rights impacts. For example, a factory that exploits its workers may also have poor  environmental practices. Completing the salient human rights assessment has supported us to deepen our understanding of how our actions to  manage modern slavery risks align with our broader work to respect all human rights. While the six salient human rights issues above are all of  equal importance to Optus, our work to manage modern slavery risks are particularly relevant to the following areas:  1.	 Supporting safe and fair work in our supply chain 2.	 Avoiding adverse human rights impacts on the communities where we operate 3.	 Providing a safe and equitable workplace 4.	 Working to secure the safe and healthy use of our products, especially by children (recognising that children can be especially vulnerable   to exploitation online)  Supporting safe  and fair work in  our supply chain Working to secure  the safe and healthy  use of our products,  especially by children Avoiding adverse  human rights impacts  on the communities  where we operate Providing a safe  and equitable  workplace 19 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 20 ===== 2. Identifying our modern slavery risks Understanding our modern slavery risk profile The table below highlights six areas of our operations and supply chain where we consider there may be potential for modern slavery to occur if our controls were not effective. It also identifies risk factors that may  contribute to the vulnerability of workers to exploitation. The key controls we use to manage modern slavery risks are set out in the following section. During the reporting period we re-validated our understanding of our modern slavery risk profile by undertaking a desktop review of key factors (including sector, product and geographic risk factors) and the  evidence base for modern slavery across relevant risk areas. This process drew on expertise from an expert business and human rights advisory firm, as well as information from credible third-party reports and tools  from the Australian and US Governments, expert civil society groups, and other stakeholders.    Our Operations Overall, we assess that our operations involve a comparatively low level of modern slavery risk. This reflects factors such as the concentration of our direct workforce in Australia and the nature of the work typically  undertaken by our people. However, as outlined below, we recognise that there are areas of our broader operations where modern slavery risks could occur if our controls and risk management was not effective.   In line with the UNGPs, we assess that we could be directly linked to any potential modern slavery that might occur in the areas identified below.  Potential risk area where modern   slavery could occur  Potential modern slavery risk factors that may   contribute to the vulnerability of workers  How this risk area is   relevant to Optus Partner groups operating  branded retail stores •	 Use of franchisee and licensee arrangements may affect visibility of  working conditions in partner-operated stores. We have an extensive network of franchisee and licensee (partner) group operated stores  around Australia, who are responsible for engaging employees. Further information about how  we engage with our partner groups to address potential risks is set out on page 34.    Services provided by workers  in offshore contact centres •	 Use of lower skilled labour, which may include migrant workers who  may be vulnerable to recruitment fees, have limited understanding of  workplace rights, and face other barriers in seeking assistance.  •	 Workers may be located in countries with differing levels of modern  slavery risks and legislative and other protections. Our operations are supported by employees of our suppliers based outside of Australia. For  example, approximately 5,000 staff located in India and the Philippines provide contact centre  services to our customers. Further information about how we engage with our customer  success contact centre suppliers to address potential risks is set out on page 34. 20 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 21 ===== 2. Identifying our modern slavery risks Understanding our modern slavery risk profile (continued) Our Supply Chains Overall, we assess that our greatest exposure to modern slavery risks is through our supply chains. The level of modern slavery risk in our supply chains varies by category and may be shaped by factors such as the locations  where suppliers and their sub-suppliers operate, the types of workers involved in the supply chain (e.g. whether workers are part of more vulnerable groups such as migrant workers), and the nature of the materials used in  the production of products for Optus. While the categories below may involve higher modern slavery risks, we consider that other areas of our supply chain are likely to be lower risk, such as our engagement of professional  services providers.  In line with the UNGPs, we assess that we could be directly linked to any potential modern slavery that might occur in the areas identified below.   Potential risk area where modern   slavery could occur  Potential modern slavery risk factors that may   contribute to the vulnerability of workers  How this risk area is   relevant to Optus Contractors building  and maintaining  telecommunications  infrastructure •	 Use of lower skilled contracted labour who may have limited understanding of workplace rights, and face other  barriers in seeking assistance.  •	 Use of raw materials which may involve higher modern slavery risks, including where these materials are sourced  from countries with a high prevalence of modern slavery.   •	 Potential provision of services outside core business hours (such as at nighttime), which may increase the difficulty  of identifying exploitive practices by limiting visibility of working conditions. We engage a range of contractors in Australia to build  and maintain infrastructure. Further information about  our supplier risk management approach is set out on page  34. Contractors providing  cleaning, security,  waste removal  and other property  management services •	 Use of lower skilled contracted labour, potentially including migrant workers who may be vulnerable to recruitment  fees, have limited understanding of workplace rights, and face other barriers in seeking assistance.  •	 Potential provision of services outside core business hours (such as at nighttime), which may increase the difficulty  of identifying exploitive practices by limiting visibility of working conditions.  •	 Sourcing from sectors that can involve strong pricing competition and where labour costs comprise a significant  portion of suppliers’ expenses, which may incentivise suppliers to reduce costs by engaging in exploitive practices. We engage a range of contracted service providers to  support our operations, including by providing cleaning,  waste removal and property management services for our  offices and security services for our sites across Australia.

Identifying our modern slavery risks Understanding our modern slavery risk profile (continued) Our Supply Chains (continued) Potential risk area where modern   slavery could occur  Potential modern slavery risk factors that may   contribute to the vulnerability of workers  How this risk area is   relevant to Optus Procurement of products for  resale and not for resale (eg  devices, tablets, accessories,  IT and network technology  equipment, and uniforms)  from suppliers •	 Use of lower skilled or low wage contracted labour, potentially including migrant workers who may be vulnerable to  recruitment fees, have limited understanding of workplace rights, and face other barriers in seeking assistance.  •	 Use of transport and logistics services such as shipping and warehousing where workers may be vulnerable to  exploitation, including where they work in isolated conditions (such as seafarers).  •	 Use of raw materials which may involve higher modern slavery risks, including where these materials are sourced from  countries with a high prevalence of modern slavery.  We have previously identified construction and  maintenance support equipment; electrical  equipment, components and supplies; and  electrical wire management devices and  accessories as higher risk supplier categories.  Further information about how we manage  modern slavery risks related to the procurement  of products is set out on page 35. Workers providing storage  and warehousing services  •	 Use of lower skilled contracted labour, potentially including migrant workers who may be vulnerable to recruitment  fees, have limited understanding of workplace rights, and face other barriers in seeking assistance. •	 Potential provision of services outside core business hours (such as at nighttime), which may increase the difficulty of  identifying exploitive practices by limiting visibility of working conditions. We engage a small number of suppliers to  provide storage and warehousing services.  22 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Case Study: Understanding our modern slavery risks in our supply chain through   an updated modern slavery questionnaire As outlined in our FY22 and FY23 Statements, a key focus area for Optus has been exploring options to  further refine our supplier questionnaire process. During the FY22 reporting period, we implemented a  modern slavery questionnaire for our key suppliers using ethiXbase.  During this reporting period, we worked with ethiXbase to update the supplier assessment questionnaire  to be reissued to high-risk categories identified through our Supplier Engagement Roadmap work, including  those which were assessed as high risk due to their responses to the previous ethiXbase questionnaire. We  sent the updated questionnaire to identified high-risk suppliers in April 2024 and will report on the results in  the FY25 Modern Slavery Statement.  2. Identifying our modern slavery risks 23 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Case Study: Assessing risks through  our tender process Our leverage to influence suppliers’ modern slavery risk management approaches can vary due to a range  of factors, such as the size of our spend and the length of our relationship with the supplier. Importantly,  our level of leverage can also vary based on the stage of the procurement process. For example, our work  on the Supplier Engagement Roadmap highlighted that our ability to seek information from suppliers  about modern slavery risk management and our leverage to influence positive action may be higher during  the tender process, compared to once the contract has been signed with a supplier.  We have continued to use tools such as the ethiXbase questionnaire as a targeted mechanism to gather  information from existing suppliers in relation to their modern slavery risk management. However, we are  also working to strengthen our broader capacity to gather information about relevant modern slavery  risks and how they are managed at the commencement of our relationship with a supplier. As recommended by our Supplier Engagement Roadmap, we commenced developing a list of modern  slavery related questions to include in the tender process during the reporting period. Our Supplier  Engagement Roadmap includes a set of suggested tender questions, which we are using as the basis for  this work. Our focus is on developing questions that are practical and easily understood by prospective  suppliers and which will enable us to gather critical information on their modern slavery risk level and  approach to modern slavery risk management. We will progress this work over the next reporting period  and will report in more detail on these activities in our FY25 Modern Slavery Statement. During the reporting period, we were also able to pilot the use of tailored modern slavery tender questions  in a uniforms procurement. All suppliers answered the questions in their responses and we used this  information to help inform our decision on appropriate vendors.

The Board approves Optus’ statement each year, which  provides an opportunity for engagement about Optus’ modern slavery risk management approach.  Optus ESG Committee To support ongoing engagement with senior executives, an Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Committee was also established in FY25. A primary  role of this Committee involves reviewing Optus’ response to modern slavery risk managing and reporting, and other ESG matters. This committee reports  into the Optus Executive Committee. We will provide further information in the next statement on the functioning of this group. Modern Slavery Working Group Manages implementation of Optus’ Modern Slavery Action Plan and may play a role in managing responses to modern slavery incidents or allegations  under the Modern Slavery Incident Response Plan. Includes representation from Sustainability, Finance, Legal, Procurement, Risk, Internal Audit,  People and Culture, Retail and Service. The Optus Group has a detailed  set of policies and guidelines, and  risk management framework,  to address key risks, including  vendor and supply related risks,  and are subject to review by and  reporting to the Board and its  committees This section of the statement explains our work in each area. Our response to modern slavery is led by our cross-functional Modern Slavery Working Group.   The Sustainability and Procurement teams also engaged with key Working Group representatives throughout the year to progress work specific to their area.   The visual below shows how responsibility for modern slavery is incorporated into our governance structure. 5	 Changes to Optus’ governance  structure were put in place in mid- 2024 and will be outlined in more  detail in the next statement. 27 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks  ===== PAGE 28 ===== 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks Sustainability  Our Sustainability team is responsible for leading and facilitating the implementation of our modern slavery response in collaboration with our Procurement team. The Sustainability  team seeks to support and enable change within Optus, including developing Optus’ modern slavery reporting and collaborating with various functions on integrating sustainability  priorities and targets within our day-to-day operations.  Importantly, the Sustainability team is also responsible for Optus’ broader work to respect human rights, including the Optus Human Rights Statement. This supports the team to  integrate our modern slavery risk management with our wider work on human rights, including through processes such as our salient human rights assessment. Procurement Our centralised Procurement team works closely with the Sustainability team to lead and facilitate the implementation of our modern slavery response. The Procurement team  supports the business to undertake transparent and effective sourcing processes, assess supplier practices and align commercial and business goals with Optus’ values and public  commitments. During the reporting period, our Procurement team also included a Supplier Management Centre of Excellence function responsible for providing dedicated support and  advice to internal business units on contract management, sustainable procurement, and supplier management. Legal Our Legal team provides legal support for our response, including providing guidance on issues such as the development and use of modern slavery contract clauses in our agreements  with suppliers. Internal Audit Our Internal Audit team provides independent, objective assurance over the controls put in place to manage risks across Optus, including modern slavery.  Internal Audit’s investigation  team may play a role in identifying and then investigating modern slavery related complaints received through our whistleblower mechanism or other reporting channels. Risk Management Our Risk team oversees the operationalisation of the risk management framework across Optus, which can include the management of risks relating to modern slavery. People & Culture Our People & Culture Team is responsible for the development and implementation of our People & Culture policies, procedures and practices, and manages engagement of contingent  workers under contracts put in place with oversight from the Procurement team. Enterprise and Business,  Customer Solutions and  Customer Success Our core product and services teams play a role in managing potential modern slavery risks related to the products and services provided by Optus, including retail stores and franchises,  our offshore contact centres, and provision of services to our enterprise customers. The role of our different teams Our modern slavery response is supported by a range of business units across Optus.  These teams all play important roles in managing our modern slavery risks. 28 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 29 ===== 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks Our policies Our policies and procedures underpin the way we engage with our people and suppliers,  including in relation to issues such as modern slavery. Policy How does the policy support our modern slavery response? How is the policy implemented? Human Rights  Statement Our Human Rights Statement was launched in December 2020 and reinforces our commitment to respect all  human rights. It provides an overview of our approach to human rights, the standards we set for ourselves and the  expectations for the people who work for us, and on our behalf. The Human Rights Statement specifically sets out our  commitment to prohibit child labour and modern slavery in any form. Our Human Rights Statement is published on our website. Optus has  also increased awareness and access to this Statement through our  internal communications with links to the Statement. The Human  Rights Statement is also promoted through our annual modern  slavery e-learning module. Procurement Policy The Procurement Policy’s objective is to ensure all goods and services are acquired via standard process, mitigating  risk. As part of this Procurement Policy, we require suppliers to agree and comply with The Singtel Group Supplier Code  of Conduct. The Procurement Policy is published on our Optus intranet. The policy  is regularly reviewed and we communicate any policy enhancements  and changes across our business. Supplier Code   of Conduct The Singtel Group Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the expectations of all suppliers with whom the Singtel Group  (including Optus) does business. It includes a specific section on human rights, including modern slavery, which sets out  the Singtel Group’s prohibition on the use of modern slavery in its operations and supply chains and expectations for  suppliers. This includes a requirement for international suppliers to have systems to demonstrate compliance with ILO  Conventions on labour standards, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights  of the Child. The Supplier Code of Conduct also addresses issues that may be indicators of modern slavery, such as  harassment and corruption. The Supplier Code of Conduct is published on the Singtel Group  website. It includes details of mechanisms available to suppliers to  report any potential breaches. To do business with Optus, all our  suppliers must confirm their acceptance of, and comply with, the  Supplier Code of Conduct. This requirement is included in contractual  agreements with suppliers. 29 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 30 ===== 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks Our policies (continued) Policy How does the policy support our modern slavery response? How is the policy implemented? Contractual Terms  and Conditions We require our suppliers to take reasonable steps to identify and prevent the occurrence of modern slavery offences in  their organisation and supply chains, as well as those of any third party with whom they do business. Importantly, our  suppliers are asked to notify us upon becoming aware of any modern slavery issue occurring in their organisation or  supply chain. See further information in the case study on page 31. Where appropriate, we discuss these contract clauses with suppliers  during contract negotiations. We may also ask our suppliers  for access to reports, certifications, audit reports, information  and documents, including the completion of a self-assessment  questionnaire to assist us in monitoring ongoing compliance with  these terms and conditions. Employment  Policies and  Frameworks Optus is a leading employer and developer of talent in the Australian market and provides a comprehensive framework  for employment. This framework is underpinned by industrial instruments approved by the Fair Work Commission and  provides minimum terms and conditions of employment for our people beyond minimum statutory legal entitlements.  Employee terms and conditions of employment are comprised of Optus’ relevant industrial instruments, contracts of  employment and employment related policies and benefits, which build on minimum employee entitlements. Employee contracts of employment provide for, at a minimum,  terms and conditions of employment that meet legislative and  the relevant industrial instrument obligations. Optus’ industrial  instruments and policies, which enable and support employee terms  and conditions, are also published on the Optus intranet. 30 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Case Study: Developing tiered contractual clauses addressing  modern slavery for use based on supplier risk level Contracts with suppliers provide an important tool to set clear requirements related to modern  slavery risk management. Through our work on the Supplier Engagement Roadmap, we identified  an opportunity to enhance our current standard clauses to help ensure they remain fit for purpose.  This includes developing tiered clauses which can be used based on the modern slavery risk level of  the supplier. For example, a more detailed clause could be used for a high risk supplier, while a low risk  supplier could draw on a simpler clause.     As part of the development of the Supplier Engagement Roadmap we reviewed existing model  clauses about modern slavery produced by the Australian Government and the NSW Anti-Slavery  Commissioner. We also reviewed the types of modern slavery related tender questions and clauses  used in current agreements with higher risk suppliers, such as property management and uniforms.   Following completion of the Supplier Engagement Roadmap, we commenced developing tiered  contractual clauses, focusing on a more detailed modern slavery clause for procurements identified  as high risk and a simpler clause for our lower risk procurements. Preparation for these activities  started at the end of the reporting period covered by this statement and the majority of this work  will be progressed over the next reporting period (the financial year ending 31 March 2025). We will  report in more detail on these activities in our next statement. See further information on our Supplier Engagement Roadmap development on page 32. 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks 31 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 32 ===== 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks Our Modern Slavery Action Plan Our internal Modern Slavery Action Plan identifies key steps we plan to implement to continue to refine our modern  slavery response. To provide clear accountabilities for action, each recommendation in the Modern Slavery Action  Plan is assigned to a business unit to progress. The Working Group also tracks the implementation of the plan at its  meetings. We periodically refresh and update our Modern Slavery Action Plan. For example, during the reporting period,  we added additional action items identified through our Supplier Engagement Roadmap.  Our Supplier Engagement Roadmap  During the reporting period, we finalised our Supplier Engagement Roadmap to support our work to  assess and address modern slavery risks in our supply chain. The aim of the Roadmap is to provide us with  a practical framework to guide and prioritise our engagement with our suppliers about modern slavery. We developed the Roadmap in consultation with an external business and human rights advisory firm.  The Roadmap was also informed by a series of internal consultations with relevant supplier category and  relationship managers.  The Roadmap identifies: •	 potential areas of modern slavery risk across our supply chain, including by re-validating previously  identified risk areas •	 key recommended actions to refine our understanding of potential risk areas focused on mapping our  supply chain and understanding our high risk categories  •	 how we can better engage with our Own Brand suppliers in relation to modern slavery risk  management •	 opportunities to develop and refine overarching controls to build into our procurement process to  support us to identify and manage modern slavery risks.  We have integrated key recommendations from the Supplier Engagement Roadmap into our Modern  Slavery Action Plan and took steps to progress a number of these actions during the reporting period,  including: •	 Reviewing high risk areas for modern slavery in our procurement categories and identifying the  suppliers in these areas •	 Developing a guidance document for suppliers on operating effective grievance mechanisms •	 Developing tiered contractual clauses addressing modern slavery based on supplier risk level •	 Developing a formal process for assessing modern slavery risks in the tender process through a  targeted questionnaire •	 Developing ‘palm card’ indicators setting out modern slavery red flags for Optus staff to be aware of  when engaging workers or directly with suppliers Preparation for these activities started at the end of the reporting period covered by this statement and  the majority of this work will be progressed over the next reporting period. We will report in more detail on  these activities in our next statement. 32 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 33 ===== 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks Our Modern Slavery Action Plan   (continued)  Our approach to due diligence We remain committed to continuously strengthening our understanding of potential modern slavery and other  human rights risks relating to our operations and supply chains. We also value dialogue with our enterprise and  business customers and regularly respond to requests for information about our modern slavery approach.  Our current approach to due diligence is applied to all suppliers who want to do business with Optus. We take  a tiered approach through segmentation of our suppliers based on their criticality to our core business and  environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, including human rights, decarbonisation, and governance to  tailor our engagement accordingly.  Our supplier risk management framework begins as part of the sourcing and onboarding process in prequalification  by including ESG questions and clauses to assess supplier existing practice. The supplier risk management  framework continues through the contract lifecycle and involves cross-functional collaboration with key  stakeholders from across the business. During the lifecycle of the contract, suppliers undertake different risk  management actions such as regular performance review meetings, audits, training events, and provision of data. During the reporting period, we also worked through our Supplier Management Centre of Excellence to enhance  our procurement processes, which included a review of Optus’ current procurement processes and policies against  public sustainability commitments and best practice frameworks.  Preparation for these activities started at the end of the reporting period covered by this statement and the  majority of this work will be progressed over the next reporting period (the financial year ending 31 March 2025).  We will report in more detail on these activities in our next statement. Case Study: Applying due diligence  checks to recruitment of our  contingent workforce Optus engages the services of contingent workers through an approved panel of  15 HR Recruitment service suppliers and two payroll providers. These workers are  engaged for defined periods of time to temporarily supplement the workforce  and can be engaged across various business units. The panel of HR Recruitment  services suppliers was established in 2023 following a robust procurement process  and must be used by all Optus business units when engaging contingent workers.  The HR Recruitment service suppliers approved for the panel were selected through  a process which includes full compliance to Optus policies and procedures, this  includes compliance with our standard modern slavery contract clauses.  The HR Recruitment service suppliers are required to undertake pre-employment  checks on all workers provided to Optus, which includes verifying workers are eligible  to work in Australia as well as other probity and background checks.   Optus undertakes annualised audits of the contingent worker cohort to verify key  information, including that the workers are eligible to work in Australia. The most  recent audit in 2023 covered the entire Optus contingent worker cohort and did not  identify any non-conformances relevant to Optus’ modern slavery risk management. 33 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 34 ===== 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks Managing Modern Slavery Risks   for Key Supplier Categories  In addition to our standard procurement processes, we also work closely  with key suppliers to support our efforts to manage modern slavery risks.  Contact centres Partner retail stores  Facilities  We work closely with our third- party Customer Success contact  centre suppliers in India and the  Philippines to help provide a safe  and fair working environment for  the approximately 5,000 workers in  these locations.  During the reporting period, we  undertook in-person visits to key  contact centre sites. This enables us  to speak directly with workers and  monitor practices on the ground.  More broadly, we continue to engage  with our contact centre suppliers  through quarterly surveys, periodic  virtual events and targeted sessions  with contact centre workers to seek  their direct feedback. We undertake financial and probity  checks for prospective partners  and set clear standards for Partner  conduct through our franchisee  and licensee agreements, including  compliance with relevant laws and  work, health and safety requirements.  We also have monthly and quarterly  performance meetings with our  Partners, as well as annual reviews.  This engagement helps us to maintain  a high level of visibility of Partners’  businesses. Any compliance issues  would generally be identified and  managed by our retail teams on a day  to day basis. BGIS is currently contracted to manage and deliver  Optus’ facility management services across all facilities  nationally. This includes services such as cleaning  and waste management, landscaping and garden  maintenance, and general handyman services. Our contract with BGIS includes a modern slavery clause  (described in our 2022 statement). We work closely with  BGIS to monitor compliance with relevant contractual  obligations, including through monthly reviews and  quarterly senior management meetings. Among other steps to manage potential modern slavery  risks, BGIS undertakes annual audits of subcontracted  providers to verify they are paying their workers  appropriately. BGIS’ audit for the 2023 calendar year did  not identify any concerns in relation to subcontractors  servicing Optus sites. BGIS also requires its suppliers to  sign an annual statutory declaration confirming workers  have been paid in accordance with relevant legislation. 34 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Case Study: Understanding risks in our  Own Brand supply chain Through our work on the Supplier Engagement Roadmap, we undertook a detailed desktop review of our  Own Brand suppliers, including our suppliers for modems, mobile phones, and packaging for our products.  This review has supported us to identify key areas where we can work with these suppliers to encourage  better modern slavery risk management. Our desktop review evaluated publicly available information shared by these suppliers in relation to their  modern slavery risk management, including whether they report publicly that they: •	 Have a policy commitment to respect human rights, including modern slavery, referencing the UNGPs; •	 Conduct modern slavery risk assessments; •	 Undertake supplier engagement in relation to modern slavery risk management; •	 Have a commitment to remediation in line with the UNGPs; •	 Have a grievance mechanism to report modern slavery concerns; and •	 Undertake training for workers on human rights, including modern slavery. Through this process, we identified an opportunity to continue to work with our Own Brand suppliers to  encourage them to ensure they have implemented effective grievance mechanisms to enable the safe  reporting of modern slavery concerns by workers and other stakeholders. We have commenced development  of a grievance mechanism guidance document for our suppliers, including our Own Brand suppliers to  support our work in this area. See further information about this work on page 39. 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks 35 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 36 ===== 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks Training Training is a key component of our modern slavery response because it helps us to ensure our people understand the  role they can play in preventing and managing modern slavery risks, including by safely reporting concerns.  During the last reporting period, we reviewed and updated our modern slavery e-learning module to  further tailor the content to Optus’ context and modern slavery risks. Completion of this module is  required learning for all Optus leaders and all staff in certain business units, such as Procurement.  The training is also available to all other Optus staff, including retail and franchisee store owners. The  Sustainability team monitors completion rates for this training across the business for reporting. During the reporting period, approximately 9,810 people completed the e-learning module. This included  approximately 3,000 permanent staff, as well as other contractors (onshore and offshore) and relevant  external services workers. Over the next financial year, we will review the current list of employees required  to complete the learning to expand to other relevant employee cohorts. We also delivered a modern slavery awareness session in June 2023 for staff working in procurement  related roles. This session was delivered as a lunch and learn presentation and included information about  why modern slavery is relevant to Optus, the requirements in the MSA, Optus’ modern slavery risks, and  the steps Optus is taking to manage these risks. Further training for category and vendor managers is  planned for later in 2024 and additional details on this session will be included in our next statement.  36 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 37 ===== Case Study: Developing ‘palm card’ indicators setting out potential modern slavery red flags  for Optus staff to be aware of when engaging workers or directly with suppliers Our work on the Supplier Engagement Roadmap reinforced the  importance of ensuring that our workforce understands key  modern slavery risks and red flags, particularly those staff who  engage directly with workers or suppliers. During the reporting period we developed a list of ‘palm card’  modern slavery indicators for relevant Optus staff that engage  with third party workers or suppliers. This document highlights  potential modern slavery red flags and is intended to be used by  relevant Optus staff, particularly those engaging with suppliers  in the areas we have identified as higher risk. Our aim is to equip  our staff to better identify potential modern slavery by helping  to ensure they are equipped to identify and report possible red  flags.  We will report on our work to finalise and implement these ‘palm  card’ indicators in our next statement. Further information about our Supplier Engagement Roadmap  development is on page 32. 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks 37 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 38 ===== 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks Collaboration and stakeholder engagement We see collaboration with our business peers and other stakeholders as key to building and maintaining a strong  response to modern slavery. During the reporting period, we continued to contribute to the development of  collaborative, business-led responses to modern slavery through three key forums. This included attending a  number of meetings and events throughout the reporting period. Forum How we engage How this engagement has supported our modern slavery response UN Global Compact Network  Australia (UN GCNA)  Modern Slavery Community  of Practice As a signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2007, we are committed to upholding  its 10 principles including human rights and labour issues. As part of this commitment,  we actively participate in the UN GCNA, including its Modern Slavery Community  of Practice. The Modern Slavery Community of Practice is a small, interactive forum  with membership from a range of Australian businesses and meets quarterly. It aims  to provide a collaborative forum to support Australian businesses to manage and  communicate modern slavery risks and develop good practice responses. Optus’ membership of the Modern Slavery Community of Practice has helped us to better  understand various other industry sector practices, challenges and learnings on how we can  improve our modern slavery risks.  Telco Together Foundation Optus is a member of the Telco Together Foundation (TTF), an industry network that  brings together 21 telecommunications organisations operating in Australia. Our actions to manage modern slavery risks through an industry wide approach. During the  reporting period, we worked with the Telco Together Foundation to explore the scope to use  third party data providers. We also explore with our TTF industry colleagues areas such as  mapping areas of our supply chain beyond Tier 1 and assessing industry and purchase risk. The Groupe Speciale Mobile  Association (GSMA) The GSMA represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, bringing together  more than 750 operators and approximately 400 companies in the broader mobile  ecosystem. As a global member led organisation, Optus (through its Singtel’s  membership), has opportunities for collaboration on a range of topics, such as modern  slavery and human rights, providing valuable insights and enabling members to work  towards common goals. We continued to engage with GSMA over the reporting period about broader sustainability  issues. 38 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 39 ===== 3. Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks Grievance mechanisms   and remediation In line with the UNGPs, we are committed to providing for, or  cooperating in, remediation where we identify that we have  caused or contributed to human rights harm, including modern  slavery. This commitment is set out publicly in our Optus Human  Rights Statement.  The reporting channels that we have in place provide an avenue  for workers in our operations and supply chains who have a  concern about modern slavery to safely make a complaint. We  understand that these mechanisms can only be effective if they  are trusted and accessible and we continued to promote the  Optus Whistleblower Hotline and other methods for raising  concerns through relevant materials over the reporting period. Case Study: Developing a guidance document for suppliers  on operating effective grievance mechanisms  for modern slavery concerns We have identified that there is an opportunity to engage with our Own Brand and other suppliers to support them to implement  and maintain effective grievance mechanisms to enable the safe reporting of modern slavery concerns by workers and other  stakeholders.   We are developing a guidance document for suppliers on operating effective grievance mechanisms, which will draw on the  expectations set out in the UNGPs and provides a practical checklist suppliers can use to self-assess their response. The final version  will also outline Optus’ expectations for suppliers in this area.  We will report on our actions to finalise and implement this initiative in our next statement. 39 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 40 ===== Case Study: Workers’ Awareness of   Reporting Channels We continued in person visits to our overseas Customer Success contact centres  in India and the Philippines during the reporting period.  During these visits, we have introduced a formal site audit tool which includes  asking a small sample of contact centre workers about their awareness of  reporting channels that could be used to safely report any concerns, which could  include complaints about their working conditions.  Initially, workers’ responses suggested that the levels of awareness may differ,  but awareness appears to have been steadily increasing. Feedback from Optus  staff undertaking these visits indicates that there has been an increase in the  promotion of reporting channels to workers by Customer Success contact centre  operators, such as through posters, screensavers, and emails. There have also  a number of instances where workers in overseas Customer Success contact  centres have utilised the Optus Whistleblower Hotline to report concerns.  However, none of the matters raised in the reporting period related to modern  slavery. We will continue to work with our contact centre providers to support  the promotion of grievance channels going forward.  Site visits may also include ‘fireside chat’ style sessions or more open forum  events to help solicit direct worker feedback about their experiences. 3.

Our actions to manage our modern slavery risks Our Whistleblower Hotline What it enables Reporting of any unethical and inappropriate conduct or concerns, such as fraudulent, corrupt  or illegal activity, including any potential complaints related to modern slavery. The hotline  service is operated in accordance with the Singtel Group Whistleblower Policy, which provides all  whistleblowers with protection from detrimental conduct, such as reprisals and retaliation. Who can use it All Optus employees and company officers, partners and their employees, contractors and authorised  representatives of suppliers and suppliers’ workers, people that used to be in one of these groups and  family members of any person in one of these groups. How it operates and how  complaints can be raised Optus’ whistleblower process provides multiple channels for complainants to lodge reports. These  include via email, online portal and phone number to our designated whistleblower service provider,  members of the Optus Internal Audit team, and persons or parties identified in the Singtel Group  Whistleblower Policy as Eligible Recipients for complaints concerning Optus. The persons designated  as Eligible Recipients include designated members of the Optus senior leadership team, the  designated Whistleblower Investigations Officer and Whistleblower Protection Officer for Optus,  members of the Optus Internal Audit team, certain specific roles such as Optus General Counsel, and  certain external parties as required by the law in Australia concerning whistleblowing. Safeguards The Singtel Group Whistleblower Policy contains safeguards to protect the confidentiality of  complaints and to protect complainants from detrimental conduct, such as retaliation. The Policy  allows complaints to be reported anonymously and we commit that we will never attempt to  establish a complainant's identity. The structure in place allows for confidential communication with  a complainant through a portal that protects anonymity.  How many modern slavery  complaints were received  through this hotline in FY24 All complaints received through the whistleblower hotline were investigated and none were related to  modern slavery. 41 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 42 ===== 3.

Assessing our effectiveness How our modern slavery response   has evolved since 2019  In addition to the activities set out in this statement for the reporting period, we have achieved a range of key milestones in our modern slavery risk  management since 2019. Tracking our effectiveness helps us to improve and build on our response both now and into the future. Developed modern  slavery action plan to  guide response 2019-20 Undertook modern  slavery risk assessment  of suppliers using  expert third party Established modern  slavery working group Revised contract  clauses to address  modern slavery 2020-21 2022-23 Launched Human  Rights Statement Enhanced our modern  slavery e-learning  module Implemented modern  slavery e-learning  module  Commenced  development of a  Supplier Engagement  Roadmap    Revised Supplier Code  of Conduct to address  modern slavery Conducted a detailed review of an Own Brand  modem supplier and also engaged with a uniforms  supplier to better understand their modern slavery  response. Signed Australian  Telecommunications   Leadership Statement   on Human Rights and   Modern Slavery 2021-22 Undertook salient  human rights  assessment with expert  third party Developed Modern  Slavery Incident  Response Plan Delivered targeted  modern slavery  training to over 100  Optus team members Rolled out targeted  supplier questionnaire 44 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 45 ===== We consider that an effective business response to modern slavery involves multiple elements. These elements include: a meaningful understanding of potential or actual modern slavery risks across the business’  operations and supply chains; the capacity to address these risks through practical actions, such as meaningful supplier engagement and collaboration with stakeholders; and the development of processes to  remediate or cooperate in the remediation of any modern slavery-related harm the business identifies it has caused or contributed to. We currently assess the effectiveness of our response against a range of  quantitative and qualitative criteria, as set out below:  Effectiveness criteria How this criterion helps us understand effectiveness The successful implementation of action items under our Modern Slavery Action Plan Tracking our progress in this area helps us identify areas of our response that are progressing well and areas where further  work may be required The number of targeted (role specific) staff who have completed our modern slavery  e-learning module and feedback from staff who have completed other training  sessions, including the e-learning Tracking the number of staff who complete training and any feedback assists us to understand levels of modern slavery  awareness across our business and where there are opportunities to further tailor training to address key knowledge gaps Completion rates for our supplier questionnaires and any supplier feedback about the  questionnaire process Tracking the implementation of our supplier questionnaires and any supplier feedback supports us to understand whether  the questionnaires are fit for purpose and identify opportunities to further refine the process The number of modern slavery-related complaints reported to our Whistleblower  Hotline (or other channels) and whether any cases were substantiated Tracking the number of modern slavery related complaints received and whether any cases were substantiated helps us to  assess whether our grievance mechanisms are able to identify and respond to modern slavery incidents or allegations and  whether we are able to meaningfully investigate and address any complaints Any feedback from our suppliers, staff, business partners or other stakeholders Internal and external feedback helps us to understand different perspectives on our modern slavery response and identify  opportunities for continuous improvement Information about good practice provided through collaborative forums such as the  UN GCNA Modern Slavery Community of Practice and the Telco Together Foundation  that can be used to benchmark our own processes Participation in collaborative forums helps us to continually improve and better understand how our response compares to  key peers across the telecommunications sector and more broadly with the aim of adopting other best practice initiatives.  Optus representatives participate in the quarterly Roundtable discussions. We track our performance against these criteria through both internal and external mechanisms. Internally, we leverage the expertise in our Modern Slavery Working Group to monitor and seek internal  feedback on the impact of our actions. Externally, we welcome feedback from our suppliers, staff, business partners, expert advisors and other stakeholders. We also draw on collaborative forums such as the  UN GCNA Modern Slavery Community of Practice and the Telco Together Foundation to consider good practice and identify areas where we can improve our response. We acknowledge that measuring the  effectiveness of our actions is complex and we will continue to look for opportunities to expand and strengthen our approach to measuring effectiveness. 4. Assessing our effectiveness 45 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 46 ===== Case Study: Benchmarking of our modern   slavery reporting In early 2024, we engaged a specialist business and human  rights advisory firm to undertake a benchmarking exercise  evaluating our modern slavery reporting and reporting of a  selected peer. The aim was to identify key areas for improvement  in our reporting which we could consider in the drafting of this  statement. We presented the results to our Working Group and have  used this process to understand how our reporting aligns with  external stakeholder expectations and to support us to further  improve our reporting, including providing additional detail on  our identification and assessment of risks.  More broadly, this benchmarking has also allowed us to compare  our response with our peer to understand how we could enhance  the effectiveness of our own actions. 4. Assessing our effectiveness 46 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Consultation 5. 47 | Optus Modern Slavery Statement 2024  ===== PAGE 48 ===== Consultation to develop Optus’  Modern Slavery Statement  Reporting entities (and other controlled entities) covered by this Statement all share the same company  secretary, whose team was consulted in developing the Statement, including reviewing draft versions of  the Statement.  The overall development of the Statement was led by the Working Group, which includes representatives  from key functions across the Optus group relevant to modern slavery risk management, including  Sustainability, Finance, Legal, Procurement, Risk, Internal Audit, People & Culture, Customer Success and  Customer Solutions. The Working Group members contributed to and reviewed drafts of the Statement.  This consultation process helped to further ensure that the statement reflects the modern slavery risk  exposure and risk management activities of the reporting entities and owned and controlled entities  covered by the statement.    Consultation on Optus’   modern slavery response  In addition to consultation to prepare the Statement, Optus continued to consult internally on the  implementation of our broader modern slavery risk management processes throughout the reporting  period. Our Working Group provides the primary mechanism for cross-functional consultation, but we  also engage with other business units as required. 5.

As part of this, Optus are committed to  serve our community and have a positive  impact through our sustainability programs  and initiatives. Many of our sustainability  initiatives provide our customers with options  that positively increase their own impact  on the environment and community.  Optus sustainability strategy –  delivering to our commitments  We can achieve a more sustainable future when we  work together. As a business we have developed  a Sustainability Strategy that drives shared value  between our customers, the community, and the  environment. We focus on measurable and tangible  ways to make positive impact through our six pillars –  Climate Action, Circular Economy, Digital Enablement,  Sustainable Innovation, Future of Work and Equity  & Inclusion. We are proud to have achieved and even  exceeded some of our FY25 targets this year outlined  throughout this report. Connecting people is at the heart of everything we do,  and this year a key focus for us has been connecting  our customers with sustainable causes they care about  through our services. Here are some ways we have  progressed against our sustainability commitments  and engaged our customers in positive social and  environmental activities: Climate Action At Optus, we recognise the role we play in linking our  community to a future with reduced carbon emissions.  We have a long-time commitment to enhancing the  environmental sustainability of our operations and  assisting our community in joining us on the path  towards a sustainable and robust future. Through  initiatives such as Optus Eco, customers have power  to personalise their experience and, in a positive  way, amplify their environmental impact through the  My Optus App, including by supporting local offset  projects that are meaningful to them. In FY23 we reduced our absolute (market-based)  emissions by 12.9% year-on-year, getting us closer  to our target of 25% reduction by FY25, in line with  Scope 1 and 2 Science-Based Targets. Singtel Group  was one of the first companies in Asia (ex-Japan) to  have carbon emission reduction targets approved by  the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in 2017.  During the year, we completed an internal review of  our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emission targets to be in line  with a 1.5-degree global climate scenario alongside  a roadmap to achieve this. We are in the process of  engaging SBTi with these updated 2030 emissions  targets and will share details in due course.  Another important aspect of climate management  is ensuring access to communications infrastructure  during natural disaster weather events. We invested  in nine additional Satellite Cell and Trailers (SATCATs)  to substantially strengthen our disaster response  capabilities and provide mobile network connection  where traditional infrastructure was damaged.   FY23 was another difficult year for many rural  communities exposed to various natural disaster and  extreme weather events. We’ve been able to adapt  quickly and introduce resilient systems to withstand  outages. The expansion of our SATCAT fleet has  allowed us to provide immediate connectivity support  to affected areas during this year’s flooding in rural  New South Wales and Queensland. Read more about  our disaster response on page 33. Circular Economy Our commitment to circular economy principles for  waste reduction remained steadfast this year. Through  our Circular Economy Roadmap, we established a plan  to attain our targets of making all Optus branded  products packaging 100% recyclable, reusable or  compostable by FY25.  This year, a key milestone was the launch of our first  environmentally friendly modem, made from 95%  recycled plastic and packaging that is 100% recyclable  with no single-use plastics. This gives our customers  the choice to purchase products that will reduce their  own environmental footprint. Closing the loop, we  also offer customers options to recycle or repurpose  their old handsets through our Donate Your Device and  MobileMuster programs. Our IT and Networks teams have also contributed  significantly to reuse and recycle our e-waste, with 97.3%  of our e-waste from Networks and 100% from IT diverted  from landfill, a proud achievement as we have already  exceeded our goal of recycling 90% by FY25. Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Climate   Action Connecting  Australia Future   of Work Equity and   Inclusion Overview 3     |     Overview  ===== PAGE 4 ===== Digital Enablement We continued our commitment to educating young  people to be safe digital citizens online. Our Digital  Thumbprint program delivered free facilitator-led  and online learning workshops to 80,547 young  people across Australia, exceeding our FY25 target of  educating 550,000 young people. Our whole team is  incredibly proud of this achievement. We expanded  the program this year to deliver in-person facilitated  workshops to schools in more regional areas across  Australia. More of this on page 45. The Living Network’s Donate Your Data program  continues to be one of the most effective ways to  address the digital divide that exists for vulnerable  and disadvantaged individuals and families. This year  our customers donated over 12 million gigabytes (GB)  of data to those who don’t have regular access to the  internet, were caught in natural disaster crises or are  experiencing domestic and family violence. Sustainable Innovation We know that technology is a great enabler in  addressing social and environmental challenges  that we face in society. Through our Optus Future  Makers program this year, we funded five new  social innovators to build and scale their social and  environmental tech innovations. As a business we have   partnered with three of our Future Makers alumni to  pilot their solutions since the program started in 2017.  Read more about this year’s pilots on page 52. This year we also launched a $1.4 billion sustainability- linked revolving loan facility – the first of its kind in   the Australian telecommunications industry. This   gives us great insight into investor’s sustainability   goals, the type of commitments they want to see,   and directly aligns our financing strategy to the   group’s sustainability targets.  Future of Work Optus adopts a proactive stance in readying for the  workforce of the future. We recognise that digital  platforms, which now simplify daily life - such as  AI, machine learning and cloud services - will be the  foundation of this workforce transformation. Our  approach provides our employees opportunities to  acquire new skills, sculpt their careers, and prosper   in a digital future where prioritising customer  experience is paramount. To equip us for the constantly evolving digital  landscape, we are providing our people with the  opportunity to obtain micro-credentials through   Optus U. This year, we introduced new streams-of- learning within Cyber Security, Data Science and  Artificial Intelligence (AI). We also tripled our Tech  Talent Graduate intake, welcoming 54 students in  Software Engineering, Cyber Security, Digital and  Data & Analytics. By providing access to advanced  learning, our people can gain verified recognition of   in-demand capabilities, allowing them and their  careers to thrive in the future digital world. Future of Work also focuses on how we can lend  a helping hand to disadvantaged individuals and  communities, empowering them to develop their  own future focused skills. These initiatives revealed  overwhelming feedback from our amazing Optus  people who welcome the opportunity to volunteer,  mentor and champion those in need of real support.  A huge thank you to all our people who put their hand  up to volunteer this year through our programs and  initiatives. Find out more about this on page 59.  Equity and Inclusion We believe that the strength of our business stands  on the foundation of our diverse, vibrant and talented  workforce. These diverse backgrounds, life experiences  and perspectives of our people enable us to better   service our customers, produce innovative offerings,   and make better business decisions. Fostering diversity  within our team generates a beneficial ripple effect  within the larger community.  This year our team designed and developed our first  Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). To launch  in early FY24, the RAP is our guide to fostering and  strengthening relationships with Aboriginal and   Torres Strait Islander peoples, communities,   partners and businesses. We have been investing into the next generation  of leaders, through our Pathways 2 Employment  program and partnership with the Australian Business  and Community Network, having also exceeded our  FY25 target in supporting career aspirations through  mentoring, skills transfer and employment opportunities  for 5,000 disadvantaged youth.  Over the last few years, we have also highlighted the  importance of respecting the human rights of people,  both within our immediate network and supply chain.   In FY23 we released our third Modern Slavery Statement,  outlining our progress against our action plan to respect  the human rights of all people within our areas of  influence and reach.  Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Climate   Action Connecting  Australia Future   of Work Equity and   Inclusion Overview 4     |     Overview  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Cyberattack In September 2022, Optus suffered a cyberattack by  a determined, skilled cybercriminal who targeted our  customers’ personal information. Data privacy and  protection have always been important elements of  our ESG commitment. Our customers are our most  important ‘social stakeholder‘ and respecting and  protecting people’s privacy is important to us. We  are deeply sorry the attack impacted our customers,  and we are committed to taking the action needed  to do better in the future. We have learned a great  deal through the experience, and we have committed  to sharing those learnings in the spirit of making  Australia stronger and better. Once we realised the attack had occurred, we were  laser-focused on preventing our customers from harm  through the potential misuse of their information, and  that objective guided all our decisions and actions. It led us to announce what had happened quickly to  put customers on alert. It led us to engage extensively  with the government and financial institutions to  work together to protect customers, and it led us to  communicate openly and transparently even when we  didn’t have all the answers. We also proactively helped  each person understand what was recommended by  the authorities for their specific situation and covered  the costs to customers of replacing identity documents  where advised to do so. It wasn’t the year many of us at Optus expected, but  its challenges brought even stronger comradery and  dedication from all our Optus people.     Our resilience has been on full display this year,   showcasing our unwavering challenger spirit which is  an intrinsic part of who we are. We have continued to  connect with our customers, communities, network,  and each other as we navigate through what has  happened, and looking ahead identify where we can  improve. And most importantly, we have never lost  focus on our customers and our commitments which  we continue to honour. Through the challenges and accomplishments of   this year, we are united as a team and are optimistic  about the future. We remain steadfast in our vision  to power optimism with options. Thank you to all our  customers, stakeholders, partners, and Optus people.  What we can achieve together is greater than we can  ever achieve alone. We hope you enjoy reading about our continued  sustainability journey and progress and always  welcome your feedback.

By building meaningful  relationships, we can gain insightful feedback  from stakeholders, which informs our   decision-making as a business and helps  to build trust. We proactively communicate with our diverse   range of stakeholders in a variety of ways,   such as face-to-face and virtual meetings,  roundtable discussions, forums, events, surveys,  customer success representatives and direct  feedback obtained via email (sustainability@ optus.com.au). Our sustainability strategy is  formed in collaboration with our stakeholders  through a thorough materiality review every  three to five years. This enables us to prioritise  the most relevant concerns of these groups and   ensure that we are identifying and addressing   the issues that matter most to our stakeholders.  Our stakeholders Throughout this report you will discover our  trusted partnerships and active engagement  with a range of stakeholders, as we seek to  collaborate on initiatives where we can make  a more meaningful and sustainable impact by  working together.

We recognise that First  Nations people have been part of Australia’s history  for over 60,000 years. Before telecommunication as  we know it today, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  peoples communicated through word of mouth, art,  celebrations, and corroborees. Given this connection, we aim to deepen our  relationships with First Nations communities and  cultivate a deeper understanding of Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander cultures within our organisation.  This is integral to our organisational culture and  fulfilling our commitment to being Australia’s   most loved everyday brand with lasting   customer relationships. Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) Reconciliation Australia’s Reconciliation Action Plan  (RAP) framework is an opportunity to detail our  central vision, purpose and strategic commitment  to delivering measurable positive outcomes for First  Nations peoples, Optus, our customers and broader  community. In FY23 Optus designed and developed a  Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Launched in  early FY24, the RAP focuses on how Optus will forge  a long-term commitment to meaningful and positive  outcomes for and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander peoples. Optus’ mission for reconciliation is “to ensure  this future leverages the power of inclusivity. It is  with courage, respect and a commitment to listen  and to learn that we strive to provide meaningful  opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander peoples to develop, contribute and be part  of the digital economy. We will use our RAP to make  meaningful progress and impact, further fostering   and strengthening relationships with Aboriginal   and Torres Strait Islander peoples, communities,  partners and businesses.” We encourage you to read our Reflect Reconciliation  Action Plan and commitments via our website. KARI Foundation Since 2018, Optus has partnered with the KARI  Foundation to provide educational opportunities for  Aboriginal youth, supporting them to achieve, thrive  and belong. Each year Optus provides financial and  mentoring support to 20 Indigenous students entering  their final years of high school. The financial support  covers educational-related expenses for students,  including excursions, books and materials, and the  mentoring support provides an avenue for young  people and Optus employees to share perspectives   and build relationships. Optus and KARI have also come together -   through a series of co-designed workshops to  create a shared cultural awareness with employees,  and canvass greater opportunities for mentored  scholarship students. Furthermore, KARI Foundation is also a partner in our  digital inclusion program, Donate Your DataTM. The  program provides a free 4G SIM so participants can  access the internet and stay connected to friends and  family via free calls and texts. Over 1,000 Indigenous  young people and families were supported through the  KARI Foundation using Donate Your DataTM. Find out  more about Donate Your Data on page 48. Engaging an Indigenous supplier network As outlined in our RAP, we aim to increase Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander supplier diversity to support  improved economic and social outcomes for these  communities. Our plan involves developing best  practices to promote and build confidence across the  business to engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander suppliers, and to further integrate our existing  Supply Nation membership within Optus’ procurement  policies and processes.

We strive to adhere to the highest  standards of personal and corporate integrity,  outlined in our Code of Conduct.  We expect our people to embody these principles  in all their actions and decision-making, to conduct  themselves in line with our organisational values.  Our people participate in Appropriate Workplace  Behaviours compliance training as part of their  onboarding process which covers our Code of  Conduct. Employees have access to the Code  via our website and the Code is referenced in  the various compliance learning modules that  each individual must complete annually. In line with our Code of Conduct, we must comply  with all laws, regulations, codes of practice, and  legal, regulatory and licensing requirements, including  directions and orders of any government or statutory  or regulatory authority in the areas in which we  operate. This includes tax regulations in Australia –  more on this on page 22. Our Code of Conduct aligns with our Anti-Bribery and  Corruption, Fraud Investigation and Whistleblowing  policies, which are Singtel Group-wide policies.   In FY23 41 complaints were reported to our  Whistleblower service, with 12 cases being  substantiated, 15 not substantiated and 14 carried  forward at 31 March 2023. Of the 14 cases brought  forward at the end of FY22, 5 were substantiated  and 9 not substantiated. It is a decrease from the  preceding years, with 62 and 87 complaints received   in FY22 and FY21 respectively. How sustainability is governed Optus is led by Singtel Group’s sustainability  governance and management of ESG and  sustainability governance key performance indicators  (KPIs). The Singtel Board provides oversight to the  Group, along with the Management Committee and  Risk Management Committee, on material ESG topics.  The Group CEO provides the Board with regular  updates on various sustainability programs, upcoming  activities, and updates on global trends that have an  impact on our sustainability strategy.  Optus has a Group Sustainability team to focus on  ESG and sustainability-related activities in Australia  and bridge the local strategy to the Singtel Group  sustainability strategy. The Australian and Singapore  sustainability teams regularly come together to drive  and collaborate on sustainability programs and share  best practices across the Group. The Singtel Group  sustainability governance structure is available   within the Singtel Group Sustainability Report. Management of ESG KPIs Many sustainability issues are consistent across   the countries in which the Group operates, and  therefore we have linked collective and common   ESG targets to KPIs, such as: 	• 20% of our Top Executive’s long-term incentive  plan remuneration policies are tied to specific,  time-bound key performance indicators (KPIs)  such as reaching 32% of female employees in  management by FY25 	• ESG targets for our Management Committee’s  short-term incentive plans represent 10% of  their annual balance scorecard performance 	• Management Committee’s KPIs are cascaded  down to their business units, departments and  employees, whose performance bonus and  other incentives are tied to their KPIs. These targets cover key sustainability themes such as: 	• Climate change and environment - as measured  by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 	• Reputation and responsible business practices -  measured by the MSCI ESG Index 	• Community impact, in terms of our digital  inclusion and enablement targets 	• Talent and people including diversity   and talent retention.

We acknowledge tax transparency improves  the community’s confidence in the corporate sector.  As a signatory to the Board of Taxation’s voluntary tax  transparency code, we’ve published Tax Transparency  Reports since FY18. You can find out more about our  approach to tax, and our latest Tax Transparency  Report on our website. You can also view more details  about our Tax practices in the Singtel Group Report. Security and data privacy Our Privacy Policy outlines our strict procedures  that govern the handling and protection of sensitive  customer information. We value the privacy of our  customers and their data, which is stored within our  networks and systems, as our customers may come   to harm if their data is compromised or misused.  We have in place safeguards and controls for the  protection of customer data. We continue to record customer privacy complaints  that are referred to us by our customers, staff, other  individuals or regulatory bodies. In FY23 there were 77  cases of non-cyber-related complaints, categorised as  privacy incidents. Of these, nine cases were referred  by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman  (TIO), and one case from the Office of the Australian  Information Commissioner (OAIC). We met the  threshold to notify the OAIC on one occasion, which  was related to the Optus cyber incident, and reported  a Notifiable Data Breach relating to the personal  information of 9.8 million customers. In September 2022, Optus suffered a cyberattack  that resulted in the exposure of some customers'  personal information. We communicated openly and  transparently with all stakeholders affected and  worked closely with the government and financial  institutions to protect our customers. We took  immediate corrective action to prevent similar   cases from recurring. We also committed to covering the cost of replacing  identity documents, such as drivers licences, for  customers advised to do so. In April 2023, a class  action against Optus was filed in the Federal Court  of Australia on behalf of customers in relation to  the cyberattack. We will defend the proceedings. In  addition to the measures already taken, we continue to  provide support for customers impacted by the attack. Fair and ethical marketing In FY23, Optus did not receive any fines from the  Australian Communications and Media Authority  (ACMA). However, we were subject to one sanction  from the Australian Competition and Consumer  Commission (ACCC) during the year: Optus was fined  $13.5 million for allegations of false and misleading  representations in relation to the sale of NBN plans in  2019 to about 20,500 customers. The ACCC alleged  Optus made representations that customers who  acquired an Optus plan would obtain a speed estimate  before the line was activated, that Optus would check  the speed of the line after connection and that Optus  would provide alternate options if the estimated speed  could not be met, and that Optus wrongly accepted  payments from customers. As a result of Court orders  and declarations regarding Optus’ breaches in respect  of the contraventions to ss 29(1)(g) and (m) to the  Australian Consumer Law (ACL), Optus was required  to pay a penalty of $13.5 million, plus $100,000 in  costs, to undertake a customer remediation program,  maintain and update our compliance program. This  matter was heard in court on 10 November 2022.  Sustainable  Innovation Digital  Enablement Circular  Economy Climate  Action Connecting  Australia Future  of Work Equity and  Inclusion Overview 22     |     Overview  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Connecting Australia  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Our Network Network coverage –   enhancing our 5G Network As a leading telecommunications company, Optus  has a significant responsibility to keep our customers  and the wider community connected. We remain  committed to enhancing the customer connectivity  experience while also maintaining existing and forging  new partnerships to develop future ways of connecting  people and communities. We are committed to building Australia’s fastest 5G  network, because a fast and reliable network creates  possibilities. It can accelerate impactful innovation,  increase productivity for businesses; enable powerful  knowledge sharing, and help to build meaningful  personal and community connections. This year, Optus rolled out an additional 1,200 5G  sites, bringing our total to over 3,000 5G sites. We  have broadened our 5G reach to include additional  regional towns and upgraded keysites that many  of our customers rely on the most, such as Sydney,  Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide airports.  To serve more customers in areas where mobile  coverage would usually be challenging, we have  upgraded almost 1,000 sites with a 900Mhz low   band spectrum, which extends our 5G coverage   by 20% per-site basis.  5G Standalone Network  After almost a year of testing and several customer  trials, this year we launched our 5G Standalone  network. Our new 5G Standalone network doesn’t  rely on the 4G radio and core network, which means  more of our customers’ devices can communicate  simultaneously at higher speeds and, in future,   can connect to 5G in more places. As the technology matures, our customers will  experience even faster speeds, greater reliability   and lower latency. These capabilities will create  an ideal environment for delivery of richer user  experiences, like gaming, Artificial Reality (AR),   Virtual Reality (VR) and Extended Reality (XR).  Looking forward, we are developing additional   5G Standalone features such as network slicing.  This will enable customers to slice the network into  different virtual segments, allowing each slice to be  uniquely configured to optimise speed, reduce data  lags and latency, and increase flexibility.  Greening our 5G Network  Upgrading our 5G networks to provide the best  coverage increases our energy demands and resulted  in an increase of emissions. Given this, we are  progressively upgrading our network with state- of-the-art hardware to enable energy efficient site  solution deployment. This addresses both sustainability  and site deployment challenges, by reducing total  footprint, materials used, and power consumption.  This modernisation of hardware, along with its energy  saving features, show a reduction of 42.5kWh - which  is equivalent to 31kg CO2eq per site per day - resulting  in a realised energy reduction of 31% in the cost per  gigabyte (GB). Read more about our environmental  network activities in the ‘Climate Action’ section   of this report. Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Climate   Action Overview Future   of Work Equity and   Inclusion 24     |     Connecting Australia Connecting  Australia  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Radio Access Network (RAN) Optus and Ericsson have deployed a unique   radio access network (RAN) solution to leverage  lightweight, new generation ratios and basebands   that reduce energy consumption by up to 25%.  This solution supports the sustainable growth of  Optus’ mobile network whilst contributing to Optus’  sustainability commitment to reduce carbon   emissions by 25% by FY25.  Following the initial deployment at the Moorebank  site, Optus is beginning to upgrade equipment at sites  across its network: resulting in a decrease in energy  consumption, aiming to save approximately 40kWh  per day when coupled with energy-saving software  features. You can read more about this carbon  reduction project on page 29. Resilient Network We continue to undertake extensive climate scenario  analysis to pre-empt worsening natural disasters  and invest in adaptation of our network for climate  resilience, indicated in our inaugural Task Force on  Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report,  published in FY22. In FY23 we continued collaboration  with our stakeholders across the infrastructure  ecosystem and have together identified vulnerable  sites which will be incorporated into a microgrid pilot.  This will help to ensure our sites remain operational  at times when the main power supply is affected by  extreme weather events. New Satellite technology While we have a strong track record in delivering  services to rural areas, Australia’s vast landmass   and rugged terrain have made it difficult to provide  mobile coverage everywhere needed, especially   in remote locations. This year we successfully conducted a live  demonstration of satellite direct-to-mobile technology.  This technology enables a standard mobile device  located outside of the terrestrial network to access  the satellite network, offering a much-needed solution  for customers and communities not covered by the  existing network. This will benefit those living in   remote communities, and even those out at sea   off the Australian coast, allowing them to stay  connected. We will continue to explore the rollout   of this technology in FY24. ''At Ericsson, sustainability is integral to our business  and has become a fundamental part of how we operate  and innovate. This new RAN deployment represents an  important step toward our mission to achieve net-zero  across our value chain by 2040 and cut emissions by 50%  in our portfolio in use and supply chain by 2030. We are  proud to have collaborated with Optus in creating a RAN  solution that will continue to support the development of  Australia’s sustainable future.''

Our two targets drive our strategic focus on Climate  Action: to reduce 25% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions,  and to procure 100% of our electricity requirements  from renewable-backed sources by the end of 2025.  Aligning with SDGs 9, 11, and 13, we aim to reduce  our organisational carbon footprint, and provide  opportunities for our customers to reduce their  individual carbon footprint in partnership with us.  Through initiatives such as Optus Eco, customers   have the power to personalise their experience and  amplify their environmental impact through the  My Optus App, including by supporting local offset  projects that are meaningful to them. The Singtel Group was one of the first companies  in Asia to have carbon emission reduction targets  approved by the SBTi in 2017. During FY23, we  completed an internal review of our Scope 1, 2 and 3  emission targets against a 1.5-degree global climate  scenario. The refreshed target will be announced in due  course when revalidated by SBTi. We are continuing  to engage with our suppliers on our shared emissions  and are working collaboratively to build a roadmap to  guide future emission reduction strategies that we   can achieve together between FY24 and FY30.

We have seen the Ukraine War unfold and  the energy crisis that followed, as well as supply chain  challenges. These developments have resulted in cost  increases in electricity and renewable energy project  developments which have significantly changed the  economics and supply capacity of our energy needs,  including our renewable energy plans, which we will  share in due course.  Despite these challenges in FY23, we signed our first  Renewable Energy Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)  with Red Energy, including their TrueGreen product,  for approximately 158GWh of our national load. Our  contracting pipeline for additional renewable energy  PPAs is currently a work in progress. While this may  pose supply and inflationary risks to our original RE  targets, we will continue to update and disclose the  developments of RE contracting with our customers  and other stakeholders as we progress. Case Study: Embodied Carbon – Upstream Supply Chain emissions  This year we worked closely with Nokia and Ericsson  to better understand and quantify the embodied  carbon emissions associated with our 5G network  infrastructure. Embodied emissions include emissions  associated with the construction processes and  materials used in building and upgrading our mobile  network. We are also working with our major suppliers  to refine the embedded emissions allocations to  understand their own emissions reduction targets   and commitments.  As a result of this collaborative engagement, we  now have a more comprehensive understanding  of our emissions inventory and clear insights on  targeting future emissions reduction improvements.  This will ensure that, together with our suppliers, we  are focused on maximising the emissions reduction  opportunities that have the most impact on our   shared environmental ambitions.  Energy reduction initiatives  In FY23, we continued to make progress on our   energy reduction target by initiating a project to  identify opportunities throughout our network.  Through this project, we realised a reduction of  18.9GWh of electricity from the decommissioning   of legacy, redundant, defunct and end-of-life network  elements and their associated components.

Scope 3  represents Optus’ largest emissions source, making   up 81% of our total emissions.   In FY23, our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based)   emissions decreased by 0.4% and 12.9% respectively  compared to FY22, resulting in an overall reduction  of 50,889tCO2e from the previous year. In addition,  we made improvements to our Scope 3 accounting  method for Category 1 and 2 which resulted in lower  estimated emissions this year when compared to FY22. We have also seen an increase in our Category 5, 6   and 7 emissions as staff return to work and business  travel resumed after COVID-19 restrictions eased.   The table, right, depicts the performance of our   Scope 1, 2 and 3 since FY21.  1 Restatement: We are reporting our emissions from transport and distribution to Category 4 from Category 9 from last FY, following the GHG protocol Scope 3  calculation guidance - ' Outbound logistics services purchased by the reporting company are categorized as upstream because they are a purchased service'. 2 Restated FY21 and FY22 Category 11 figures to reflect suitable power consumption for modems sold.

Customers have the option to  offset some of their mobile phone’s environmental  impact and support Australian carbon reduction  projects, which is further amplified by Optus   matching what our eligible customers offset. In the My Optus App, customers can: 	• Go paperless by opting to receive their   bills and invoices online to reduce paper   waste and carbon emissions 	• Connect to a plastic-free digital eSIM   to reduce plastic usage and waste 	• Offset some of their mobile phone’s   carbon emissions by supporting Australian  carbon reduction projects, with additional  offset-matching provided by Optus to   eligible customers Combating climate change is a collective effort and   we all have a role to play to halt and reduce global  carbon emissions. Our support of selected Australian  carbon reduction projects is in addition to, and  amplifies, our existing climate action commitments  to meaningfully reduce our emissions and switch to  renewable energy. Together with our partner GreenCollar, we invest in  local offset projects that have meaningful impact  on the Australian environment and adhere to the  government’s accreditation standards. We purchase  Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) to offset our  carbon emissions and invest in, and support, locally   run sustainability initiatives. ''Our research shows that consumers   want to take tangible environmental  action, but they don’t always know  how to go about it.

As of 31st March 2023, Optus has 92 hybrid vehicles,  equating to 51% of passenger vehicles in the Optus  fleet. A further 51 hybrid vehicles are expected for  delivery in FY24 and 7 more are projected for FY25. As Optus’ regional network operations require vehicles  that can carry heavy equipment loads, there are  limited commercial electric vehicle options available  in the Australian market. While this makes setting a  target to fully electrify our company fleet challenging,  we were excited to pilot our first electric vehicle (EV)  with our Sydney-based Networks Building Operations  team, to evaluate which vehicles best support our  sustainability practices whilst maintaining operational  efficiency. The key factors for consideration are the  vehicles’ fit-for-purpose features, battery range,  business usage and the availability of public EV  charging infrastructure. At this stage our transition plan continues to be an  ongoing process, but we remain optimistic about  the potential electric vehicles have in enabling our  sustainability goals. In addition, at our Sydney Campus  we have made EV chargers available in our employee  car park for our staff to use at no additional cost. Switching to LED lighting In line with our focus on reducing energy consumption,  this year our Retail Property and Operations team  rolled out LED lighting upgrades across our retail  stores and network sites nationally. This not only  provides excellent lighting levels for our employees   and customers, but significantly reduces our   overall energy consumption. By the end of FY23,   we completed lighting upgrades in 12 retail stores,  and in 98% of all network sites across Australia.  Sustainability-linked financing Sustainability-linked financing refers to debt  instruments for which the interest cost is linked to  the achievement of predefined sustainability targets.  They are designed to encourage entities to invest in  initiatives that promote sustainable growth   and development. In FY23, a $1.4 billion sustainability-linked revolving  loan facility was launched by Optus under 'Olives',  Singtel’s sustainable financing program. This is the  first sustainability-linked revolving loan facility by   an Australian telecommunications company. The interest rate discounts are linked to Optus’  achievement of reducing its absolute greenhouse gas  emissions by 25% (Scope 1 and 2 in tCO2e) by FY25,  compared to its 2015 baseline. Optus was supported  for this loan by a syndicate of 12 banks. This $1.4 billion sustainability-linked loan facility is  a continuation of our $300 million bond which was  issued in FY22. This extension will help us achieve our  goals and allow our investors to participate in our  sustainability practices.

To support  our customers and communities, Optus invested  in additional disaster response innovations to  keep our network strong and resilient, and to  keep people connected with their loved ones and  disaster relief services. We are proud of the role  we play in supporting people in their time of need.  Doing so is about living our purpose, supporting  our community and inspiring our people.  We have invested in nine additional Satellite  Cell and Trailers (SATCATs) to substantially  strengthen our disaster response capabilities,  bringing our total fleet to 13. SATCATs act as  backup mobile network connections when  traditional infrastructure is damaged: they  provide temporary mobile coverage and public  WiFi for customers and communities. The portable nature of the SATCATs allows us to  deploy them rapidly to communities in disaster- affected areas. Over the past 12 months, we  have proudly supported communities isolated by  floods and other natural disasters across New  South Wales, including Lismore, Gooloogong,  Wisemans Ferry, Cattai, Windsor and Eugowra. We also designed and manufactured six Disaster  Recovery Skids (‘DR Skids’) through a co-funded  strategic initiative with the Federal Government.  DR Skids are mobile sites that can be deployed  to provide longer-term connectivity in regions  affected by natural disasters. Our DR Skids  utilise solar energy as a complementary energy  source to standby generators, which extends  their standby power and means communities’  connectivity is supported for longer.  The first DR Skid was deployed in November  2022 in response to the severe flooding in  Gooloogong, New South Wales. The DR Skid  helped Gooloogong customers and the broader  community to remain connected in challenging  times while the existing telecommunications  infrastructure was under repair. Further, to minimise mobile outages when the  power grid fails in affected areas, we have  invested in innovative backup battery solutions.  These solutions ensure that transmission  mobile sites have power and connection for an  additional 10 to 20 hours of service during a  power outage.  Telecommunications services are vital to keeping  our communities safe, informed, and connected,  especially during times of emergency or disaster.  We understand that our role as one of the largest  telecommunications providers in Australia means  that Australians rely on our services to keep  businesses running and people connected in   their time of need. Over the last year, Australia has experienced natural  disasters and extreme weather events at an increasing  frequency and intensity. Extreme weather events  and natural disasters caused damage and disruption  to many Australians and tested our individual and  collective resilience. Previous climate change risk assessments undertaken  in 2015, 2020 and 2021 have informed various network  adaptation and resilience initiatives that have enabled  us to continue serving our communities and our  emergency service providers to stay connected   during times of crisis.  At Optus, we are dedicated to ensuring that our  network remains robust, and resilient. Our climate   risk work is included within the 2022 Singtel Group  TCFD report (Task Force for Climate Risk Related  Financial Disclosures), which provides details about   our Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and   the Metrics and Targets we use to adapt to a   changing climate.

Our people worked to ensure impacted  customers were kept connected during this challenging  time by maintaining network resiliency and offering  additional support.  Despite the flooding, our network services continued  to operate as usual for our customers. We had two  autonomous mobile base stations (SATCATs) ready  for deployment at Lockridge Exchange, along with  a generator and technical support on standby at a  mobile hub site in Broome in case conditions worsened. We also provided impacted customers with additional  support including data boosts, internet assistance  kits, one month access free credit to assist covering  the cost of setting up temporary phone or internet  services, and power banks for use in evacuation  centres in the region. Supporting our customers and community in this  way was a cross-functional and collaborative effort,  bringing to life what we can achieve when we are  united by our challenger spirit, thinking ahead, and  going the extra mile to put our customers first. Eugowra flooding After flooding in Eugowra, NSW Health needed help  providing extra telecommunications coverage to the  local hospital. We deployed three Field Operations  employees to Eugowra to commission our SATCAT  mobile tower to provide coverage during the outage.  Many flood victims were displaced and were staying at  Orange Ex-Services Club. To support these people, we  provided at no cost 15 prepaid devices with $30 SIM  recharge cards included, 50 rechargeable power banks,  50 multi-charger cables, 5 power surge boards for  people to plug into, 25 reusable drink bottles and   50 prepaid $30 SIMs.  In partnership with the local Orange Harvey Norman  and the Optus Business Centre, we also provided 20  wireless modems to local businesses to help keep them  connected. View our SATCAT case study page 33 to  find out more. Case Study (continued)  This provides power authorities with  additional, and much-needed time to  restore services, or to allow Optus to access  a site safely with a portable generator. Optus Mobile Deployment Engineering  Manager, Michael van der Lit shares,  ''The new DR Skids are a  leap forward in terms of  emergency telecommunications  infrastructure. They bring together  in-house engineering innovations  that enable off-grid power,  high-speed deployment, and a  solution that can quickly restore or  provide new coverage to support  customers and communities in the  event of a natural disaster and in  their time of great need.” Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Connecting  Australia Overview Future   of Work Equity and   Inclusion 34     |     Climate Action Climate   Action  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Expanded satellite connections  for NSW Emergency Services This year we expanded our partnership with the  New South Wales Telco Authority, by increasing the  reach of the Authority’s current regional network to  provide lifesaving communication solutions for the  state’s emergency services. This partnership ensures  we can keep Australians informed and connected  during state emergencies like bushfires and floods. In line with this, we supplied the Authority with   an additional eight ruggedised Kymeta U8 flat   panel antenna (U8 antennas) to use in times  of state emergencies. This type of antenna is a  portable ‘Comms on the Move’ antenna, which  we provide in a ruggedised case to allow for easy  transport and setup. The U8 antenna will enable the Authority to leverage  the vast Optus satellite footprint to establish  a virtual point-of-presence, supporting critical  communications even when existing infrastructure  is compromised. The antenna is also easy to deploy  with minimal technical expertise required, and it will  primarily support data connectivity for deployable  Cell on Wheels infrastructure. Optus already provides a managed satellite network  to the New South Wales Telco Authority, supporting  the agency in carrying its radio-over-IP traffic, as  well as its 4G traffic, for fixed, transferable and  temporary locations. With the additional Authority  deployments, we are building further on our position  as the largest commercial supplier of Kymeta  antennas in Australia and New Zealand, with a  strong presence in regional Australia to provide  seamless, cost-effective access. ANU Optus Bushfire   Research Centre  Due to Australia’s high risk of bushfire disasters,   Optus partnered with the Australian National  University (ANU) in late 2020 to develop the ANU- Optus Bushfire Research Centre of Excellence. The  Centre was formed under the university’s School of  Engineering, for students majoring in Environment  Studies to participate.  The project is focused on the development of   bushfire management strategies using various  platforms of technology. In FY23, the Centre focused  on projects such as autonomous drones for water  control, evaluation techniques, tower-based camera  video analytics, ground-based IoT (Internet of   Things technology), and an extension of the   drone fire response. This research project will be completed in 2025, and   we will share the Centre’s developments in due course.

We believe that  by replacing, reusing and recycling, we can create  a more sustainable and resilient future for all.  Our Circular Economy strategy is driven by our   three goals: to divert 90% of our waste from landfill;  to reuse and recycle over 90% of our e-waste; and  to use 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable  packaging in our Optus products by FY25. These  targets support SDGs 11 and 12 – ‘Sustainable Cities  and Communities’, and ‘Responsible Consumption and  Production’ – which drives our focus on the broader  global effect of our actions.

This roadmap takes a lifecycle view, which  encompasses the environmental impact of   our products before they reach our stores,   during our operations, and after their useful life.  We are collaborating with Charopy, one of   the five finalists in our Optus Future Makers  program in FY23, to deploy smart bins in the  outdoor spaces of our Sydney Campus.   This collaboration is helping us to eliminate   the contamination of the materials we recover  and support the recycling of valuable materials  from our operations for re-use in the future.   Read more about Charopy on page 53. Simply Cups Simply Cups is Australia’s first coffee cup  recycling program, allowing businesses and  schools to close the loop on coffee cup usage.   We continued running this program at our Sydney  Campus in FY23 and also rolled it out to our  new Adelaide Campus. Since we partnered with  Simply Cups, we have recycled over 63,000 coffee  cups. This is a great way to reduce the amount   of coffee cups ending up in landfill – a direct link   to our 2025 target. Ensuring our packaging   is recoverable We report annually to the Australian Packaging  Covenant Organisation (APCO) and support the  implementation of the Australasian Recycling  Label (ARL) in our products to continue  improving kerbside recovery in Australia.  During FY23, we continued implementing the  actions identified in our Circular Economy  Roadmap for Packaging developed in FY22.  The roadmap highlights key opportunities to  reduce waste and provides actions across our  supply chain streams to minimise the amount  of single-use and non-recyclable packaging used  in Optus products. In FY24 we will continue to  implement our roadmap and, where practical,  update it with new initiatives as identified by  our stakeholders. A critical component of our Circular Economy  strategy is collaborating with our suppliers and  finding ways to design waste out as much as we  can. We have included material requirements  in our contracts, so we continue working with  those suppliers who are taking active steps  towards the elimination of single-use plastic  and supporting the increase of recycled content  in the packaging of their products.  Case Study: Sustainable  packaging for Modems From work to entertainment, communication to  education, the Internet has become a necessity  for everyday life. However, the devices we use to  access the internet, such as modems, can have a  significant impact on the environment.  In partnership with Arcadyan and Sagemcom,  the Optus Home Devices team developed Optus’  first environmentally friendly modem, made with  95% recycled plastics. All the modems’ packaging  is single-use plastic free. This is an important  contribution towards our target of using 100%  recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging in  our Optus products by FY25. Jack Shamoon, Optus Associate Director in the  Supplier and Commercial Devices team shares, ''Our modem sustainability strategy  makes Optus Home devices central  to delivering future solutions to help  combat environmental impact. It is one  of the ways we are enabling customers  to reduce and offset emissions to deliver  a more sustainable world.” Creating a more sustainable future is important to  Optus. Our Home Devices team has now embedded  recycled materials and plastic-free requirements  in all ongoing device-sourcing initiatives and  agreements with supplier partners.

MobileMuster As a founding member of MobileMuster, this year  we continued to support the nationwide initiative  to recycle old mobile phones and accessories to  minimise landfill. The industry-wide collaboration and  stewardship scheme allows customers to recycle their  mobile phones at any Optus retail store.  We also continued to encourage our customers  to recycle their old devices by including reply paid  recycling satchels in Optus prepaid mobile bundles.  This makes it easier for our customers to return their  unwanted devices to us to recycle, at the same time  that they are upgrading to a new device. Further, we expanded our in-store recycling program   to include modems, smart watches, smart home  devices and gaming consoles. Customers can now  recycle these electronics with confidence, knowing  that up to 99.3% of the materials in their devices are  recovered through our partners in the supply chain. In  FY23, we received over 26,832 devices, equivalent to  almost 40 tonnes3 of mineral resources saved – a great  effort from our customers.  Case Study: Providing digitised options   to our customers using eSIMs With over 4 million SIM cards ordered by  customers each year, we continue to investigate  how to reduce the amount of plastic used in  our products. Reducing plastic in our SIM cards  not only reduces waste, it can also improve our  customers’ experience. During FY23 we collaborated with our SIM  suppliers to design and launch SIM cards that are  less than half the size of the traditional SIM card.  This has resulted in a 52% reduction of plastic per  unit, which equates to an overall reduction of 10  tonnes of plastic across the year. Steven Small, Optus Strategic Portfolio   Manager shares, ''Our proactive approach to  sustainability best practice in the  Optus SIM space has produced a  plastic reduction result we are   very proud of.” In addition, we continue to offer our customers  the option to use electronic SIMs (eSIMs),  including our wholesale customers who can now  connect to the Optus 4G and 5G network more  quickly and more sustainably. Optus is the first  mobile network provider in Australia to offer  eSIMs to the customers of our Mobile Virtual  Network Operators (MVNOs) partners. This  latest SIM card evolution allows customers to  immediately activate their eSIM by scanning a  QR code. eSIMs also allow customers the option  to have two contact numbers on one device,  which can eliminate the need to carry both a  work phone and a personal phone, and also  reduce device wastage in the longer term.  Ben White, MD of Optus Wholesale,   Satellite and Strategy shares,  ''We are launching eSIMs because  our MVNO partners want to offer  their customers a more simple,  sustainable and convenient way to join  Optus’ strong, nationwide network.  Now, customers of our wholesale  partnerships will have a simple new  way of connecting without needing  to acquire a physical SIM card. It  also provides more Australians with  new ways to make sustainable,  environmentally friendly changes to  their everyday lives.” In FY23 our Optus Wholesale team was named  ‘Best Host Operator’ globally at the 2022 MVNO  World Congress in Berlin. The award recognises  the very best in operational achievements,  innovation, and excellence in the industry around- the-world. We are so proud of this achievement  as we continue to find new ways to serve our  Wholesale customers. 3 The environmental benefits are calculated only for the total of mobile  phone components (handsets, mobile phone batteries and accessories) and  do not include the expanded range of devices collected through the program  such as modems, smart home and landline phones.

In partnering with us,  our stakeholders and customers play a role in  empowering the digital future of disadvantaged  people and communities. Our Digital Enablement  strategy allows us to improve digital inclusion  for those in need and support young people to  be safe and confident online, through our many  initiatives we continued to progress in FY23. Digital   	 Enablement We know that in today’s digitally connected  world, access to technology and digital skills   are critical for education, job opportunities,  business success and staying connected with  friends and family. We have set goals to accelerate digital enablement  for disadvantaged individuals and communities.  By FY25, our Digital Enablement goals are to  “support 550,000 young people to participate safely  online” and to “connect 100,000 disadvantaged  youth and families to help close the digital  divide and support Australians in crisis”. We are dedicated to supporting the next generation  in achieving their potential in this digital era.  The digital divide exacerbates existing social and  economic inequalities which creates a cycle of  disadvantage that can be difficult to break. This is  why we are working towards bridging that digital  divide to ensure everyone has equal access to  the opportunities that digital technologies offer  to all Australians. We are committed to helping  prepare and educate young people to be safe online  and provide them with resources to help them  become confident and resilient online citizens.

This program has been endorsed by the   eSafety Commissioner as a Trusted eSafety Provider.   Through facilitator-led and teacher-led digital  interactive workshops, students learn about the  importance of cybersecurity, digital identity, digital  discernment, digital balance, cyberbullying and  respectful relationships online. In FY23, 80,547 primary and secondary   students participated in a free Digital Thumbprint  workshop. This takes our total student participation  to 552,071, exceeding our target of reaching 550,000  students by FY25. Optus’ commitment to educating  young people and their families about digital safety   is one of our key areas of focus as we continue to  rebuild consumer trust in Australia, and these results  reinforce this commitment.  This year we announced an expansion of the program,  to provide more opportunities for regional Australian  students to learn about digital safety and well-being.  We had 20,122 regional students participate in a  Digital Thumbprint workshop. This expansion also  offers a variety of resources for parents, teachers,   and trusted adults to facilitate conversations with   kids about digital safety and well-being. We also expanded our teacher-led digital interactive  for primary students, launching workshops on ‘Staying  safe on games and apps’ and ‘Keeping my information  private online’ for Years 3 and 4 students, and a  ‘Cyberbullying and respectful relationships’ for   Years 5 and 6.

The program is designed to  support disadvantaged individuals and families in  crisis, providing them with SIMs fuelled with data  that has been donated by Optus and our customers.  Recipients have access to free calls, text and 10 GB  of data provided by Optus, plus an additional 40 GB  through customer donations. In FY23, our Donate Your DataTM program has   provided over 12,007,408 GB of data to those in need.  Since its launch in December 2019, the program has  supported over 38,870 individuals, including 13,497  individuals in FY23. Through our partnerships with  charities such as The Smith Family, Good360 Australia,  and the KARI Foundation, this program provides much- needed internet access to young people, families and  other Australians who might be doing it tough, so they  can access education sites, look for work and connect  to vital services and their loved ones.  The Smith Family's 2022 Evaluation Report shares  some of the impact Optus' Donate Your DataTM  program has on their participant families.   View these key findings on the right.  “I cannot thank Optus and this program  enough everything is so expensive at the  moment and it's very good not to have to  worry if my children can call me when they  need me it's great not to have to worry  about another bill to pay.”  Parent/carer of DYD participant  supported by The Smith Family Donate Your DataTM is one of the most powerful   ways Optus, together with our customers can support  the community in ensuring no one is left behind when  it comes to digital inclusion.

Through our Donate Your  Device program, Optus customers can donate their  spare mobile phone devices to someone in need. Together with our partner Good360 Australia, donated  devices are distributed to disadvantaged individuals  and families who can then use the devices to access  education, employment opportunities or vital services.  This year we saw over 900 devices donated; these  were paired with a Donate Your DataTM SIM. To  participate, customers bring their old device into an  Optus store, where our team refurbishes the device for  donation. We then pair the device with a Donate Your  DataTM SIM so it’s ready for the new owner. This is one  of the most tangible ways our Optus customers can  make a direct impact on someone else’s life.  Within the business, older laptops and monitors   which were previously used by our Optus people   were donated to disadvantaged schools and charities.  Many older, but good quality monitors were unable   to be redistributed within the business, so our  Operations team instead donated 120 monitors   to a selection of charities. Ukraine crisis In response to the war in Ukraine, Optus supported  newly arrived Ukrainians displaced by the war through  the donation of 900 mobile phones, paired with  Donate Your DataTM SIM cards. Optus supported activation events across South  Australia, Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales  in collaboration with our charity partners Good360  Australia, the Australian Federation of Ukrainian  Organisations (AFUO), Welcoming Australia (SA) and  St Vincent de Paul (Queensland). At these events we  helped to connect newly arrived Aussies with loved ones  and support their access to vital programs and services. Our people collaborated to create this outreach  by volunteering their time at the Ukrainian events,  distributing phones, and activating SIM cards. The Donate Your DataTM and Donate Your Device  programs are both part of Optus’ Living Network,  which play a role in bridging the digital divide  experienced by many Australians in need. Read more  about these initiatives in the Digital Enablement  section of this report.  Digital Inclusion Roundtable In May 2022, Optus held its annual Digital  Inclusion Roundtable: “Empowering vulnerable and  disadvantaged Australians to thrive in the digital  world.” The Roundtables are a critical forum that bring  together the Optus CEO, senior leaders including our  Sustainability team, and our charity partners who are  helping deliver our digital inclusion programs of Donate  Your DataTM and Donate Your Device to those in need.  The session covered topics such as digital literacy, and  the participation for vulnerable cohorts.  Charities shared the positive difference the programs  are making to those experiencing disadvantage,  and insights into vulnerabilities faced by different  cohorts such as First Nations peoples, refugees and  new Australians. Also discussed were opportunities  for charities to work together and share learnings  as a collective; and building digital knowledge and  capabilities within staff and participants.

This year we ran our sixth Optus Future Makers  program, supporting five new social innovators  who have developed solutions to address one  of the following categories: ‘good health and  wellbeing’, ‘environmental sustainability’, and  ‘supporting vulnerable communities’.  This six-month program is open to social innovators  within start-up enterprises, social entrepreneurs  and not-for-profit organisations who are ready to  grow and scale their technology-based minimum  viable product. The program ran face-to-face  workshops with Optus mentors covering go-to- market strategies, product development and pitch  training. At the end of the program, the five Future  Makers program finalists had the opportunity to  pitch for a share in a $200,000 funding pool. An  additional financial bonus of $10,000 for the Yes  Impact People’s Choice was awarded to the finalist  with the most votes on the night. For a summary  of the event, you can view our media release here. Our FY23 Future Makers: 	• Danielle Owen-Whitford (NSW) – Pioneera’s  AI bot ‘Indie’ uses linguistic analysis and  psychology to improve workplace mental  health and well-being. 	• Colin Pudsey (VIC) – SilVR Adventures seeks  to eradicate loneliness and isolation in elderly  adults through meaningful and shared virtual  reality experiences. 	• Fiona Holmstrom (QLD) – STEMPunks TV is a  worldwide online streaming platform for STEM  education aimed at school students. 	• Sarah Conron and Jane Strangward (VIC) –  My Family Unit is a therapeutic intervention  solution providing organisations with a way   of supporting mothers in the workforce. 	• Martin Collings (NSW) – Charopy aims to   solve the problem of out-of-home recycling   bin contamination through its Internet of  Things technology.

One of our FY23 Optus Future  Makers finalists, Charopy, aims to eradicate  recycling bin contamination by limiting the items  that can be disposed of in out-of-home recycling  bins. Since the completion of the Future Makers  program, Optus is partnering with Charopy to pilot  their smart bins at our Optus Sydney Campus.  This will significantly reduce the amount of  contaminated recycling waste from our campus.  This pilot will be rolled out in mid-FY24. StandbyU Foundation We continued our collaboration this year with   our 2017 Optus Future Maker finalist ‘StandbyU’.   We understand that the recent Optus cyberattack  could escalate danger for our customers experiencing  domestic violence, and we wanted to ensure our  customers could access additional help and safety  support if they need it. StandbyU works with people experiencing domestic  violence by providing them with solutions to support  prevention and protection. One of their innovations  is the ‘StandbyU Shield’ – a discrete device that  vulnerable Australians can use to trigger help from  their network of safe people in times when they   are in danger.  Chris Boyle, founder of StandbyU Foundation, also  worked with our people to deliver vulnerable customer  support training with our Customer Response Teams.  The training equips our customer-facing people with  effective responses when a person experiencing  domestic or family violence reaches out to them.  In FY23, 130 Optus people attended these training  sessions, which provided practical resources for our  team on how to support customers in these instances.  Our Customer Response Team has also created a  Domestic Family Violence Playbook, which educates  our people on the considerations and solutions we   can offer customers experiencing domestic or   family violence.

We’re committed to empowering  our people with the necessary opportunities  to upskill, shape their careers, and succeed in  a digital future that prioritises exceptional  experiences for our customers. Our Future of Work strategy consists of two main  streams – employee volunteering, and employee  upskilling. This year our yes4good employee  volunteering initiative saw 14,965 Optus people   putting up their hand to support community and  charitable causes. This is driven by our target to  see the “power of volunteering harnessed to build  the knowledge and skills of 1,500 Optus people and  community leaders by FY25”. Our Optus people can  take the opportunity of up to three days of paid  skilled volunteer leave, and we are proud to have  seen many of our people rolling up their sleeves  and participating. Read more on this here. The second stream of Future of Work is employee  upskilling. Driven by our target to support “formal  future focused skills development for 1,500 employees  by FY25”, we have created opportunities for our  Optus people to proactively elevate their skill sets.

Spreading optimism in Lismore We’re proud to support customers in the moments  that matter, and help communities keep connected.  This year we extended our support to the Lismore  community which was devastated by the NSW   floods, to help them get back on their feet after   such a challenging time. Our connections at Channel 7 Sunrise alerted us to   a group of school children from Blakebrook Public  School in Northern NSW who sadly couldn’t attend  their excursion to Canberra due to the impacts of the  recent flooding in their area. Out of the 18 children in  Years 5 and 6, 14 families had either lost their home   or their job, or both. At Optus, we’re guided by our purpose – to power  optimism with options – so we decided to surprise the  students by donating the $15,000 funding needed so  they could go on their much-wanted excursion, as well  as donating a few extra items to support them, such  as backpacks, sugar glider toys and water bottles. Thanking our First Responders Optus recognises the important contributions that  our veterans and volunteers have made to our local  and national communities. In June 2022, we wanted  to show our support for the extraordinary work that  people in our communities do, so we partnered with  the Australian Retailers Association to celebrate their  First Responders Day in June 2022. We offered eligible consumer and business customers  who are First Responders access to an exclusive offer  of 10% off plan fees for the first 12 months on selected  mobile plans when they sign up or recontract on a new  plan with Optus. This is just one small way we can say  thanks for their service to our communities.

We had an uptake of over 500 accreditations,   over 180,000 hours of learning, and over 9,000   visits to our Capability Institute webpage. We also strengthened our partnerships with strategic  vendors like Google, AWS and Microsoft, offering  pathways to industry-recognised certifications. We  continued our partnerships with universities to offer  high-impact, future focused micro-credentials in   areas like Data & Analytics, Customer Experience,  Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Through the Institutes, we have had 1,908 employees  complete various programs, courses and activities  across several strategic capabilities including:   Cloud, Data & Analytics, AI, Cyber Security and 5G. Our people Our people at Optus continue to have access to digital  learning platforms like Percipio, Udemy and Coursera,  where they can access a multitude of courses, books  and audio libraries on a wide range of topics. This  enables flexibility for learners as they can create their  learning pathways and study at their own pace. Optus U is our partnered university academy that  delivers on micro-credentials. Since November 2021,  our Optus U micro-credential program has grown  significantly and in FY23 we had 595 employee  accreditations, bringing us to just under a thousand  Optus people having received accreditations since   the program’s inception.  These learning and development offerings are one   of the many ways we make personal and professional  development accessible for our people.

At Optus, we’ve created a framework called  ‘Leaders At Optus’, to lift our leadership  capacity, strengthen our impact and build better  relationships across the business. This framework  describes the specific role of leaders, four  leadership expectations, and supports our leaders  with success elements, learning experiences and  daily practices. Our Leaders at Optus mantra is  “energise and empower people to  create lasting value for our customers,  our business and each other”. Throughout FY23, there were opportunities for  Optus leaders to engage in learning programs   to enhance their capability, strengthen their  impact, and build collaborative relationships  across the business. The four leadership expectations we have  implemented across the business are to be:   Clear, Connected, Capable and Courageous   (known as ‘The 4Cs’).  	• Clear – cut through complexities and align  priorities to Purpose and Vision 	• Connected – bring people together on the  things that matter 	• Capable – secure the critical skills, talent,  time and resources, to execute great work 	• Courageous – create conditions for  openness, challenge and innovation Optus and LaTrobe   Cyberskills course Through our focus on developing future focused skills,  Optus has been working with LaTrobe University to  increase cyber skills through a range of cyber short  courses. Partnering with other industry partners  such as Quantum Victoria, CISCO, Wiley, GHD,  War on Wasted Talent and Practera, the Cyber  Security Project is designed to increase cybersecurity  capability in the industry, as part of a Commonwealth  Government Cyberskills Grant Fund program.  The Project is split into three streams, focusing on  upskilling high school students, cyber professionals,  and university student placements. High school  students are introduced to cyber concepts and  education, with over 100,000 high school students  having participated in the program. 6,805 industry  professionals have enrolled in the micro-credential  program and 166 industry-based work placements   are open for university students for completion   by the end of FY24.

This year we had 125 Talent Ambassadors, which   is our biggest cohort yet. Our Talent Ambassadors  shared authentic stories about how proud they are   to work at Optus and what their day-to-day job looks  like as part of the team. Through posting on social  media, our Talent Ambassadors have celebrated,  promoted and showcased their careers at Optus  through a united hashtag #OptusLife. The program generated over 1.5 million organic views  from #OptusLife posts, and we saw over 25,000 likes  and 5,000 comments from Ambassador posts. This  exposure has driven engagement in company-driven  content, increasing the Optus LinkedIn page followers  to over 138,000. As part of the Talent Ambassador Program, our people  were given behind-the-scenes views of Optus’ newest  initiatives and were provided with tailored training   and networking opportunities to amplify their personal  brand and social media marketing skills.  Veronica Redman, Optus Talent Ambassador   Program Manager shares,   “This program is proving to be a successful  two-way exchange – our Ambassadors are  standing out from their colleagues and our  Talent Acquisition Team is receiving more  applications from top talent in the market.” As we continue to focus on the future of our workforce,  creating opportunities to elevate our people’s voices  will always remain a priority. Through showcasing their  work, they become proud promoters of our optimistic  team culture, while showcasing Optus as an employer  of choice in the market.

Our team’s diverse  backgrounds, perspectives, skills and life  experiences enable us to develop meaningful  connections with our customers and communities,  innovate new products and services, and make  better-informed business decisions.  Gender equality remains a dedicated focus for  Optus. We continue to strive for gender equality  in the workforce, and this year we retained our  Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WEGA) status.  In FY23 we exceeded our FY25 goal of 25% of  executive roles being held by women, with 27.3%  of roles held at the close of the year. This is just  the beginning for Optus – as we continue to grow  as a business we continue to aim for a greater  proportion of women in leadership positions.  Future focused equity and inclusion strategies are  important to us. Providing employment opportunities  for the next generation of workers will help to set  them up for a favourable working career, which is  why we aim to provide pathways to employment  for 5,000 disadvantaged youth by FY25. As part of our strategy to enhance equity and inclusion  at Optus, we want to drive and demonstrate equity  in all areas of our business and network, including  our supply chains. Modern Slavery is a human rights  issue, and one of the ways we aim to address this is  through regular assessment of operations and supply  chain risks. Our target to have zero human rights  incidents in our operations and with major suppliers  reaffirms our commitment to human rights at Optus.

The program takes an  innovative, positive and proactive approach to inspiring  employees to think about what inclusion means to  them, and our collective role in fostering an inclusive  culture where we all belong. The program combines virtual reality, workshop  activities and powerful conversations with a   virtual reality (VR) experience enabling employees   to metaphorically ‘walk in someone else’s shoes’ to  elicit empathy and enable employees to feel and  experience the world from other perspectives. Since commencing the program, almost 3,000  employees have participated. It has a Net Promoter  Score (NPS) of +74 and a favourability rating of 98%.  These results make this one of the most popular  programs delivered at Optus. Case Study: Diversity   Employee Networks Optus’ Diversity Employee Networks drive engagement  and understanding and create a two-way conversation.  Employee Networks ensure our people have a place to  come together, celebrate who they are, connect with  others, innovate and elevate engagement and inclusion.  Diversity Employee Networks have been established  across five key pillars, each with   an Executive Sponsor:  	• Culture Connect – building greater  understanding and appreciation for the rich  culture and heritage diversity we have at Optus 	• Disability Network – empowering people  living with a disability or caring for those   with disabilities 	• Elevate – for those who champion   and support women in the workplace 	• Express Yourself – nurturing a safe and inclusive  environment for the LGBTQIA+ community 	• United – supporting and uniting veterans,  volunteers and their families who have or  currently serve in the Armed Forces, Police Force  or Emergency Services These Networks aspire to create an inclusive Optus  community that empowers and elevates our people  through meaningful connections and opportunities   to develop, grow and create impact.  To support our investment in early career talent,   Optus also launched a Young Professionals Community  – focused on fostering a supportive and inspiring  community for the next generation of Optus leaders  and game changers.

We  engaged with our partners at the KARI Foundation  to participate in a Cultural Awareness Workshop  on Aboriginality to increase our knowledge and  understanding of Aboriginal people, diversity, and  protocols. KARI also shared a wonderful artefacts  display and held live performances with Eric Avery   at our Optus Sydney Campus.  Our celebration of Reconciliation Week and NAIDOC  Week is just one way we demonstrate our support  for reconciliation and celebrate First Nations  cultures and histories. Our partnership with First  Nations peoples plays an integral role in paying  our respects and working towards reconciliation.  Read more about our Indigenous and First Nations  engagement on pages 57 and 65 of this report. Supporting the   Veteran community Optus is a signatory to a Veteran Employment  Program. As an extension of this commitment,  Optus is a Gold Pledge Partner with Soldier On –   a not-for-profit providing support services to   current and former defence force personnel and  their families. We have also expanded our existing  health insurance partnerships with BUPA, nib and  AIA to now include Navy Health. Our involvement  in these partnerships amplifies our existing  initiatives that drive veteran-friendly recruitment,  transitioning, retention and providing a supportive  workplace culture for all. Celebrating International Day  of People with Disability and  partnering with What Ability Supporting our mission to be Australia’s most loved  everyday brand with lasting customer relationships,  we want to ensure we are accessible and inclusive for  our people, customers and communities. Our Disability  Network formed last year to help empower Optus  people living with or caring for those with a disability. International Day of People with Disability (IDPwD)  was celebrated at Optus this year with employee  engagement events and activities. IDPwD is an  opportunity to challenge the way we think about  disability and continue to enhance our inclusive  workplace practices.  The day involved many diverse activities, including   a wheelchair basketball game hosted by Wheelchair  NSW/ACT, with our amazing people taking up the  challenge to play a game against each other.   We also had a live panel discussion which featured  special guest Ellie Cole, Optus Ambassador and  Paralympian, along with Steve Dresler, former  Parramatta Eels player and founder of What Ability,  and Optus’ own Shantel Sager, Director of Product  Development and Disability Network Deputy Chair.  Other guests included Paralympic Boccia player,   Scott Ellsworth, who our Optus people had the  opportunity to verse in a game or two. We also  welcomed disability support organisations Cerebral  Palsy Alliance and the Australian Network on Disability  (AND), Bus Stop Films and Friendship Bakery to be  part of the day’s festivities.  As part of IDPwD, we announced our sponsorship   of What Ability – an NGO service that specialises   in community access and providing disability   support to Australians.  Case Study:   Executive Women Growing our executive women population  and accelerating the growth and  development of women talent is a key  priority for Optus. Executive Women targets  are set across the organisation and are  embedded into Key Performance Indicators  to drive progress and accountability.  We have an Executive Women in Leadership  program for senior executives to support  this priority. This program involves formal  assessments of potential, coaching,  mentoring, and bespoke learning initiatives  for identified gaps or areas of aspiration.  This year we launched an Emerging  Executive Women Leaders which aims to  bolster our pipeline of women stepping up  into executive roles. In this crucial transition,  the program includes both group learning  and individualised assessments as well   as mentorship.  In alignment with the performance  management framework, there are  dedicated talent and succession discussions  specifically focussed on women in leadership  and talent pipeline. Our Executive hold  annual discussions focussed on top women  talent, their development and mobility  options across the business.

Our Elevate Employee Network led  the celebrations. As part of the event, we hosted a panel discussion  around the ‘Embrace Equity’ theme, which showcased  how we can all play a part in actively seeking out  difference as a necessary and positive enabler to  success. Our panel included four diverse speakers -  Robyn Stubbs (Executive Coach and Mentor at SMG  and ASX200 Board Director, HomeCo Daily), Asifa  Sherazi (Head of Technology, Westpac), Louise Vidal  (CEO & Founder, 42 Schools), and Andrew Buay (Group  Sustainability Vice President, Optus). These panellists  each represented one of Elevate’s strategic pillars –  Culture, Nurture, Grow and Give.  Vogue Codes This year, Optus again partnered with Vogue Codes –  an event series that profiles female industry leaders  and technology innovators to Australians through  virtual events, panel discussions, personal profiles and  in-person conferences. Across the year, Optus was  involved in their Vogue Codes Summit, Vogue Codes  Campus, The Visionary Women’s Dinner and Vogue  Trajectory Series. The Vogue Codes Summit is a STEM-focused career  series which featured some of our amazing Optus  talent, including Theresa Eyssens (Optus VP, Customer  Solutions & Cloud), Kate Aitken (Optus VP, People and  Culture), and Belinda Lofts (Optus Senior Director,  Mobile Data Service Engineering). This forum was an  opportunity to encourage women in STEM and provide  a platform for them to have a voice in the competitive  technology industry. Optus also participated in the Vogue Trajectory  Series – a digital content series featured on Vogue, to  highlight the importance of female roles in STEM. Four  of our Optus people participated, showcasing their role  at Optus and their vision for women in STEM.  These opportunities empowered our female employees  who were chosen to speak on important topics and  amplified the voice of women looking to pursue a  career in STEM. In particular, our Group Sustainability  Senior Director, Helen Maisano was featured in the  August edition where she shared the importance and  impact of social and environmental sustainability. Our Employment   Partnership Agreement We’re committed to creating an environment at Optus  that is the right place for the best people to do their  best work. Our Employment Partnership Agreement  (EPA) – approved by the Fair Work Commission – is an  integral part of how we create and foster our workplace  culture and maintain our employee relationships. Our EPA includes several benefits for   our people, including: 	• Connected Day – a day for our people to  connect with the things that they love most,  whether it’s culture, family, health or well-being 	• Blood donation leave – allows employees to  take up to 2 hours of paid leave up to 4 times a  year to donate blood 	• Increased Partner Leave – from 2 weeks to 4  weeks of paid leave 	• Kinship – recognised for employees taking  bereavement and compassionate leave 	• Primary Carer Leave – increased from 12 weeks  to 14 weeks paid leave 	• Gender Affirmation Leave – up to 4 weeks for  employees to dedicate time to transition 	• Emergency Services Leave – enhanced by  providing an additional day of paid leave   to rest and recover 	• Family and Domestic Violence Leave –   provides certainty of 10 days paid leave   a year if required Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Climate   Action Connecting  Australia Overview Future   of Work 68     |     Equity and Inclusion Equity and   Inclusion  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Case Study – ABCN Mentoring Optus is committed to empowering the next  generation to reach their full potential. In   line with our company purpose to power optimism  with options, we provide a range of employment  pathways for disadvantaged youth, and one of the  ways we do this is through our Australian Business  and Community Network (ABCN) partnership and  mentoring programs. As a founding member company of ABCN, we  celebrated 17 years of collaboration and investment  into the next generation. We work closely with  ABCN to support students from low socio-economic  backgrounds with the support of our amazing Optus  people who volunteer their time   to mentor these students.  Throughout the 2022 school year, Optus ran over 40  programs in primary and secondary schools across five  states. We had 229 Optus people who were voluntary  mentors, enabling us to reach 897 students in total  across the school year.  Optus people participated in ABCN’s Regional,   Rural and Remote (RRR) programs, now in their   second year. 60 students living in remote areas  participated in this program covering four workshops,  developing the student's confidence,   skills and aspirations.  Optus people also continued to support ABCN’s  ‘Focus’ program. The ‘Focus’ program is designed  to build leadership skills for young women in Years  10-11, teaching them how to set goals and develop a  sense of belief in their potential. During FY23, Optus  implemented five ‘Focus’ program workshops. Some of the impact results included:  “The most important thing I have learnt in  the [ABCN] Accelerate program is – don’t  be afraid to ask. I have been privileged to  work with an amazing mentor who guides  me and provides a comfortable and safe  space to talk.”  Leilani, ABCN student “This is exactly what our students need,  opening their eyes to what’s out there for  them. You can’t be what you can’t see.   For these kids’ experiences like this are   so important.”  Teacher, Western Australia We are grateful to our Optus people who have offered  their support, and for the ABCN students who allow  our people to grow their mentoring skills. We are proud  of our contribution to the community and know that  with ongoing support, we can raise up great leaders  who will drive our digital future.

An initiative  developed in collaboration with our community  partners, including ABCN, to empower disadvantaged  students. The program not only enables Optus to tap  into a diverse talent pool, we provide opportunities  for these students to develop employability skills,  gain confidence and experience and potentially  secure employment as a Christmas casual in an  Optus retail store, or the broader retail sector. In FY23, 150 students participated in  eight P2E workshops across Victoria, New  South Wales and Queensland, bringing our  reach to a total of 741 students who have  participated in the program since 2016.  One of the workshops delivered this year was exclusive  to our First Nations scholarship students from the  KARI Foundation. Following their participation,  over 50% of the students involved were able to gain  part-time employment in a retail environment.  76 of our Optus people volunteered to mentor  P2E students this year. As part of the program  the mentors help the students to identify their  strengths and develop non-technical skills required  for their future careers, such as public speaking.  One mentor shared that it’s “inspirational to see the students try   over and over to perfect presentations   and watch their confidence grow.” A teacher from Copperfield College, one of the  participating schools in Victoria shared, “The Optus Pathways 2 Employment  program was fantastic! Our students  greatly benefitted from all the activities,  tips and mock interviews.”  Together with our ABCN program, this initiative  has enabled us to exceed our FY25 target, having  now provided pathways to employment for 5,418  disadvantaged youths.

Optus is dedicated to respecting the  human rights of all people throughout our  operations and supply chains, including  the right to freedom from slavery.  Identifying and managing potential risks related  to modern slavery is fundamental to our people- focused approach as a business. As part of our  Sustainability Strategy, our FY25 goal within  our ‘Equity and Inclusion’ pillar is to have “zero  human rights incidents in our operations and with  major suppliers”. Combating modern slavery also  aligns with one of our priority UN SDGs: ‘Goal 8:  Decent Work and Economic Growth’ (see more on  page 20 – ‘Sustainable Development Goals’).  In FY23 we published our third Modern Slavery  Statement, followed by a human rights risks  assessment to better understand our business  and supply chain risks. The FY23 Optus Modern  Slavery Statement is a consolidated description of  the actions we have taken to address our modern  slavery risks, and is published as a joint Modern  Slavery Statement in accordance with section 14 of  the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth)(MSA). We have  also undertaken a risk assessment of our major  suppliers, which includes the issuance and assessment  of questionnaires to our suppliers to inform our risk  management response and ongoing training. In FY23, we also undertook a salient human rights  assessment to enhance our understanding of the  areas where we may be at risk of involvement in  human rights harm. In line with the United Nations  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  (UNGPs), we define our salient human rights issues  as those areas where the most severe actual or  potential human rights impacts could occur through  Optus’ activities or business relationships. The assessment involved a collaborative, cross- functional consultation process across our business,  including a series of interactive workshops and a  desktop review of relevant Optus materials. As a  result, we identified six salient human rights issues   as outlined below. Our salient   human rights issues Completing the salient human rights assessment has  supported us to deepen our understanding of how  our actions to manage modern slavery risks align  with our broader work to respect all human rights. This year, we updated and expanded our content  for our employee training on modern slavery, to  help empower our people to better understand our  approach to modern slavery and our whistleblower  processes. All people leaders are required to  undertake annual modern slavery training through  online learning modules that we have developed. Optus is committed to providing for, or cooperating  in, remediation where we identify that we have  caused or contributed to human rights harm  such as modern slavery, and during this reporting  period we developed an internal Modern Slavery  Incident Response Plan. This Response Plan  provides us with a framework to help guide our  response to any future modern slavery incident or  allegation and we continued to promote the Optus  Whistleblower Hotline through relevant materials. We have continued to focus on enhancing our  modern slavery response, guided by our Modern  Slavery Action Plan. We will continue to improve  our knowledge and strengthen our actions, through  training, reviewing our current modern slavery  contract clauses focusing on suppliers and countries  with higher modern slavery risks, and exploring  opportunities to work collaboratively with our  suppliers to strengthen knowledge sharing and  capacity building to better manage our shared risks.

Through their Industry Impact hub in conjunction  with members, issues of large social importance are  addressed as an industry, with the current issues being  the reduction of modern slavery in supply chains as  well as the reduction of domestic and family violence. Optus is involved in both streams of work. This year,  along with the CEOs of 17 other telecommunications  companies, Optus signed the Telco Industry Domestic  and Family Violence pledge. One of the commitments  of this pledge is to produce an action plan using the  DFV Action Framework developed in conjunction with  TTF and its members. In conjunction with four other Australian telcos, Optus  is part of an initiative to roll out a software platform,  provided by FRDM (pronounced “Freedom”) and  managed by Telco Together Foundation. The software  allows member companies to identify, address,  segment, manage and report upon potential modern  slavery risks throughout all tiers of their supply chain. Addressing this issue as an industry can have the  greatest impact in reducing the occurrence of modern  slavery by identifying and managing the risk. As well  as this, the other objectives are to reduce duplication  amongst members and reduce supplier fatigue in  answering questionnaires.

Severe drought culminated  in devastating bushfires across many parts of the  country, followed by floods and now the impacts of  the coronavirus pandemic. It is a testing time for many  individuals, businesses and communities.  These circumstances reinforce the importance of our  sustainability approach, good corporate citizenship,  and the role Optus plays in emergency response,  community resilience and promoting optimism. We are  proud of the way our people step up, and collaborate  with partner organisations and community members  to support those impacted by these events – it’s been  a superb effort! You can read more about how we  supported communities in the Supporting Resilience  section of this report, and about how we supported our  employees in the Health and Safety Always #1 section. At its heart, our sustainability program is about  connecting. We do this in a range of ways: by providing  opportunities for more vulnerable members of our  community to connect with others, connecting our  business decisions with the Paris Climate Agreement,  making sure that our connections with customers are  underpinned by ethical behaviour, robust data privacy  and security protection, educating young people to  have positive online behaviours through our Digital  Thumbprint program and connecting our employees  with our purpose as an organisation. Over the past few  years, we have sought to embed sustainability into   our culture and values, decision-making, operations   and products and services.  This means we continue to embrace more climate- friendly operations and a responsible supply chain;  we have emphasised empowering our people and  providing them with skills for the future workplace; we  have aimed to ensure we give our customers the best  possible experience through the quality and safety of  our products and services; and we continue to use our  skills and expertise to unlock greater opportunities  in the digital economy, especially for individuals and  communities who might otherwise miss out. Some of the achievements that stand out in FY20  are how our Optus team came together to support  communities during, and in the wake of, the bushfires,  including our Green Shoots program to support small  businesses to rebuild; how we worked to keep people  connected and resolve customer issues while our  networks experienced unprecedented demand due to  enforced isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic; and  how we partnered with our customers to bring greater  connectivity to people in vulnerable circumstances  through the Donate Your Data program. We are looking forward to finalising our human  rights policy and publishing our first modern slavery  statement in FY21. We are also progressing our  climate-related risk assessment and disclosures via the  Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD) framework. Our efforts to make sure Optus  is a great place to work are ongoing and we expect to  continue to expand our 5G network availability to meet  the needs of our customers. Even as we unwind restrictions, coronavirus will have  changed some things forever. More businesses will  operate differently, like health professionals using  telehealth. More people will work from home. More  families and friends will connect with their far away  loved ones using collaboration tools. We expect more  individuals and companies will rely on our services as  they have quickly embraced new ways of doing things.  We will seek to understand our stakeholders’ evolving  needs and concerns and leverage our strengths and  partnerships to help address them. The past six years’ have seen sustainability  considerations transform how we go about our  business and we are confident that in this new decade  sustainability will continue to be a defining driving force  for our stakeholders and our teams.

This is never more apparent  than during times of disaster or emergency when  telecommunications networks support response  and resilience.  At Optus, we integrate resilience into our business  and network operations to ensure we can continue  to play our part in helping communities respond to  emergencies and recover quickly afterwards. For  example, our Optus Go Connectivity service enables  business customers to keep connected via 4G backup  and dual router resilience solutions during times  of crisis. Our response in the face of emergencies was tested  during this year, first with the severe bushfires in  Australia over the 2019-2020 summer, followed by the  COVID-19 pandemic.  We understand how much everyone relies on our critical  infrastructure to stay connected to friends and family,  to schools, and to work, and so we have been stepping  up to the challenge as we know it is essential towards  maintaining a positive daily life. 8 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OUR GREATEST ASSET THE BEST EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS OVERVIEW  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Bushfire Response  Australia experienced one of its worst bushfire  seasons on record through the 2019-20 summer.  The importance of Optus’ services in keeping our  communities safe and connected through this time  was very clear.  Creating equitable changes to our services so that first  responders were supported and communities could get  back on their feet was a top priority for us.  Here’s what we did: On the front line 	• Bills waived for eligible volunteer firefighters  and SES volunteers 	• Our staff provided on‑the-ground emergency  support by bringing charging stations, prepaid  SIMs, satellite, mobile access, and more to  established evacuation centres, helping to keep  coverage there strong 	• Uncapped mobile data for access to emergency  websites and information, fire services, federal  government websites, ABC and the Australian  Red Cross for all our customers For our customers experiencing  financial hardship 	• Free call diversions from an Optus fixed home  or business phone to any mobile or fixed number 	• Extended timeframes for bill payments 	• Bill waivers in instances of extreme   financial hardship 	• Free suspension, relocation or cancellation of  an Optus fixed service 	• Free prepaid recharges for eligible  impacted customers To keep our customers connected we deployed our  SATCATs to boost coverage. SATCATS are Satellite  Cells on a trailer that use satellite transmissions for  coverage in a limited range, without the need for  infrastructure. We deployed them wherever we could to  bolster coverage and help affected residents. Enabling our people to support the community 	• Matching staff donations dollar-for-dollar   in our employee bushfire appeal  	• Providing our people with uncapped, paid  emergency service and military leave when  they volunteered in affected areas 	• Giving two days of paid volunteer leave   for non-emergency support efforts   related to the bushfires Paula one of our Green Shoots recipients visiting our Nowra store in  Central NSW Local council electricians provisioning a 9kVa generator on-board an  Optus LED screen truck, to provide electricity to a hotel in Mid North  Coast NSW  “When our communities are facing  such difficult circumstances, we  all seek to provide whatever  support we can for our volunteer  firefighters who are placing  themselves in harm’s way to  protect the lives and property  of Australians.”  Optus CEO, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin 9 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OUR GREATEST ASSET THE BEST EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS OVERVIEW  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Bushfire Response (continued) In February we also launched our Green Shoots grants  program to support bushfire-affected small businesses  get back on their feet. As part of the grant, we  offered recipients: 	• $100 per month of recurring credit for 24  months on an Optus Small Business account 	• A tablet or equivalent (memory/colour/size  specifications at Optus’ discretion) We also extended our employee volunteer program to  enable our people to support small businesses affected  by the bushfires. We understand that rebuilding communities will  be a long and difficult process, which is why we are  acting now to do what we can to support these small  businesses in getting back online and reconnecting with  their communities. Members of our Optus Central NSW team and the RFS brigade from  Parkes NSW Dervla Loughnane from Virtual Psychologist speaking to guests   on the roadshow Bringing mental health services   to regional NSW communities   As regional Australia continues to face  relentless droughts, bushfires and heatwaves,  we’ve been devastated to see how this is  affecting both the livelihoods and mental  health of the communities that live there.  To help, Optus teamed up with the Virtual  Psychologist service to bring text-based  counselling to ten regional NSW communities. Virtual Psychologist is Australia’s first text  counselling service delivered by qualified  mental health professionals, offering a select  range of psychological and counselling support  services to individuals and those in corporate,  rural and remote settings irrespective of their  mobile carrier. In 2017, Virtual Psychologist  was accepted into the Optus Future Makers  program, marking the beginning of an ongoing  engagement with our company. To show our support for communities  doing it tough, Optus held a two-week long  roadshow in the Central West region of NSW,  holding information sessions with the Virtual  Psychologist CEO, Dervla Loughnane, and  promoting the service through the media.  The roadshow offered support to locals by  providing contacts for them to confide in  and reminded them they could seek support  whenever they need by simply sending a text. Attendees included local social workers, two  drought co-ordinators from NSW Health and  representatives from Bila Muuji Aboriginal  Corporation Health Service, which covers  the towns of Bourke, Brewarrina, Coomealla,  Coonamble, Dubbo, Forbes, Orange  and Walgett.

As a result, reliance on our network became more  important than ever. As part of our response, we put  in place a range of business measures to support our  customers and community to help them navigate  through the evolving situation. Our telephone support centres, corporate campuses  and stores were also impacted by the COVID-19  lockdown, with some temporary store closures.  In response we pivoted to online shopping, and  encouraged those who needed to get in touch to use  the My Optus mobile app. We also mobilised our Retail  staff so they could supplement the load placed on our  customer support team, enabling the store teams to  answer questions and provide in-store solutions.  We also put in place a range of measures to help  customers and the community stay connected: 	• We employed an additional 500 staff from  industries affected by the COVID-19 downturn  and transferred their excellent customer  service skills to Optus 	• We provided a three-month postpaid mobile  access fee waiver for AHPRA registered health  workers to say thank you  A member of our Customer Care team in action A G’Day A Day campaign image 	• We launched a range of support initiatives for  Optus customers including bonus data boosts,  unlimited broadband, pausing of plans and  late payment fees, and a support package for  customers that required financial assistance 	• For our Small and Medium Business (SMB)  clients, Optus set up a series of initiatives  to manage higher connectivity needs and  remote ways of working, including a free trial  of Optus Loop Live – one of our most popular  business tools 	• Promoted virtual volunteering opportunities  Optus staff could support and charities at the  COVID-19 frontline that our staff could donate  to via the yes4good Optus giving portal 	• Distributed ‘emergency’ SIMS and 47 iPads  to support charities that are at the frontline  working in crisis centres and domestic and family  violence support A member of our Customer Care team   in one of our retail stores 11 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OUR GREATEST ASSET THE BEST EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS OVERVIEW  ===== PAGE 12 ===== COVID-19 Response and Support  (continued) We believe that during these challenging times, we  have an important role to play in keeping Australians  connected with their loved ones, friends and colleagues.  As a result, we launched a new campaign called  ‘A G’day a Day’ which aimed to encourage social  interaction and increase positivity and optimism during  this time of uncertainty and isolation. From cabin crew   to call centre   When we heard that Virgin Australia was  standing down staff due to COVID-19, our  talent acquisition team quickly got in touch.  We proposed a talent sharing solution where  Virgin Australia staff could temporarily join  our organisation to support our customer care  team.  Head of Talent Acquisition, Catherine  Fitzgerald said, “On a surface level, you  might not think there are many similarities  between working in aviation and in  telecommunications. But at the end of the day  – both industries are all about the customer.  We believed the skills and experience from  Virgin Australia were very transferable to our  organisation.” “ I am really proud of all our teams,  who are working tirelessly to  keep us all connected.”  Optus CEO, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin  A member of our Optus and Virgin  Australia talent sharing initiative Health and safety through COVID-19 Optus placed the health, safety and wellbeing of our  employees, customers and community at the forefront  of our response. At the same time, we worked to ensure  our networks could meet the increased demand from  those impacted who needed to keep connected socially  and maintain their business operations.  To protect our employees, we increased hygiene  practices across stores and campuses, employees were  encouraged to work remotely where possible, and  we established social distancing measures in critical  business units operating on site. We appointed business  continuity champions, first aiders and fire wardens to  support and manage any incidents and issues during  this period. A key change was to introduce alternate  work sites, including dividing our people into two teams  with physical and security restrictions to avoid the risk  of infection between teams. Temperature monitoring  screens were set up at entrances to each of our offices  with site-bound people. In line with managing the  mental health and wellbeing of our people who were  working from home as a result of COVID-19, we also  focused on injury prevention under these circumstances  and increased our support of the ergonomic needs of  our employees. Our contact centres in India and the  Philippines were also impacted by lockdowns and we  worked with the partners who operate those centres to  ensure that workers’ safety was robustly addressed. 12 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OUR GREATEST ASSET THE BEST EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS OVERVIEW  ===== PAGE 13 ===== As a leader in Australia’s digital transformation,  Optus is uniquely placed to make a meaningful impact  on people’s lives.

With those benefits, there are also  challenges as our society and individuals navigate this  rapidly changing digital world.  We are passionate about fostering responsible and  positive online experiences. Our programs to support  ‘digital citizenship’ recognise that the key to achieving  this is through early education and support to give  young people the knowledge and tools to be safe and  responsible members of the digital society. For us, digital citizenship encompasses: 	• Digital responsibility: championing an  online world of critical discernment, respect  and empathy 	• Digital safety: providing workshops and  digital tools to build a safe and positive  online experience This has been a key focus area for Optus since 2013,  and we’ve been commissioning research, hosting multi- stakeholder roundtable events, and garnering insights  from Australian students and educators through our  Digital Thumbprint Program. Recently we published  a Digital Thumbprint Impact report and a Digital  Insights 2020 report setting out four key shifts to  tackle the digital challenges that have emerged from  this work.

Important take-outs from this discussion included: 	• There is a continued need for collaboration and  action within the digital eco-system to address  the challenges that young or vulnerable people  face online 	• Algorithmic bias in AI programs can greatly  impact young people, women, the vulnerable,  and persons of colour 	• Tech creators and organisational leaders must  continue to recognise diversity when designing  AI products and services, so that young  Australians can experience new technologies  with equal opportunities 	• Human rights should be considered in the  development stage, rather than reactively  revising products if/when end-users  are harmed Digital Citizenship (continued) 17 HOME BCK FWD OVERVIEW OUR GREATEST ASSET THE BEST EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Education and  Employment We want young people, especially those from  disadvantaged backgrounds, to have the opportunity  to achieve their potential. We believe the best way  to do that is to support their education that will  help widen their employment options. We’re taking  a multifaceted approach to this goal, supporting  students’ personal and career development as well  as providing more tangible help through improved  internet access.  This year we also continued to see successful outcomes  from our long-standing partnership with the Australian  Business and Community Network which supports  vulnerable youth in career, education and life choices. In December 2019 we expanded our Donate Your Data  program to include more charity partners and enable  more Optus customers the ability to donate excess  data to young people in need.  18 HOME BCK FWD OVERVIEW OUR GREATEST ASSET THE BEST EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES  ===== PAGE 19 ===== It’s early days, but Donate Your Data is already  meeting a real community need and it’s been powered  by a surge of customer donations. Each month of its  operation, up to 91,000 customers donated data, with  up to 71% repeat donors in each month and data being  distributed to over 13,000 participants. Towards the end of our reporting period, we recognised  that the disruptions to schooling across Australia  due to COVID-19 and the requirement for students to  undertake remote learning in many states could leave  many students falling further behind. So, we decided to  extend the reach of Donate Your Data. In April 2020 we launched a pilot program with  the ABCN to distribute 500 pre-paid SIM cards to  disadvantaged students throughout NSW. If successful  and needed, the program will be expanded to 60  schools across Australia.  “It really has made a difference in  my education and I’m only where  I am today because of the help  I’ve received.”  Donate Your Data recipient Here’s what we’re doing: Donate Your Data Internet access is increasingly vital as learning  resources and job information migrate to digital  formats, yet many students can’t get access to meet  their needs. Donate Your Data addresses that challenge by enabling  Optus Postpaid and Prepaid Mobile customers on  eligible plans to donate their excess data via the  Optus Mobile App or SMS. We give participants in  the program a Prepaid SIM with 10GB of data plus  unlimited calls and text every 42 days. Every month,  data donations are pooled and then distributed as an  added data boost to help young Australians in need  realise their full potential.  Since the expansion of the program on 2 December  2019 till the end of March 2020, Optus customers  have donated over 5.8 million GB of data. Thousands  of students from The Smith Family, KARI Foundation,  Australian Business and Community Network (ABCN),  The Salvation Army, Girls Academy, yourtown and  Mission Australia will benefit from the initiative as  it continues and as we actively recruit more charity  partners into the program.

At the  heart of ABCN programs is the aim to raise students’  aspirations and increase their awareness of the  personal, educational and vocational choices available.  This is achieved through structured programs and  mentoring by business professionals in a corporate  environment, which also provides students with an  insight into the modern workplace and access to  business networks. A highlight this year was seeing three former ABCN  students integrate into the Optus team as employees.  Two of these have also contributed to ABCN programs  as mentors or facilitators.

Over the 12 months the program provided the students,  who were entering their final two years of high school,  with engaging and interactive content designed to  support their transition to their next life journey,  targeted at further education and employment. The  valued partnership provided volunteering opportunities  for 45 members of our HR team, including the  delivery of three workshops and three student  mentoring sessions.  One of those workshops focused on helping students  develop skills required to land their dream job.  Facilitated by an Optus mentor, participants were  able to step out of their comfort zone with a variety  of games and activities. Participants were grouped  into pairs and were tasked with a game where they  were required to create objects, using their bodies  as the pieces, but without talking. The activities  used throughout this program related back to  how first impressions come from a person’s body  language and how this can have an impact in an  employment interview.

In our operations, we’re focusing on a welcoming,  inclusive and diverse work-culture, recognising that  feeling included contributes to overall wellbeing. In  our engagement with the community we also aim to  see how Optus can support inclusion and wellbeing  through supporting physical and mental health,  especially people in vulnerable circumstances. We do this by contributing to causes that directly  support physical or mental health and wellbeing. Inclusion and  Wellbeing Partnership promotes safety for kids Optus has formed a joint partnership with  Optus Future Maker finalist and IOT start  up Commsync, and Optus business customer  Brisbane City Council, to give a Commsync  Safety Watch to at-risk children and youth   to help keep them safe.  Kids who are caught within a family violence  scenario can discreetly trigger their wearable  device to send an alert to members of their  safety network if they feel vulnerable or  are attacked.  The safety network will receive the wearer’s  location, a voice call (via one-way or two-way  microphone), SMS and emails. Optus provides  the cost of the watch and the cost of the  carriage as part of our donation. The initiative is managed by Commsync’s   charitable arm, the StandbyU Foundation.  StandbyU is focused on safety for women and  children. For participants, StandbyU creates  safety plans tailored to each individual based  on its extensive knowledge of the risks inherent  in child protection and domestic violence.

In February 2020, the volunteer project team at   Optus delivered a prototype for the online platform  that will be used by the Garvan and NBCF cancer  researchers to match breast cancer patients looking  for trials to hospitals and oncologists looking for local  clinical trial candidates. To make this project possible, a multi-disciplinary team  was created to include volunteers from various Optus  departments, including Finance, Digital, Customer  Experience, IT, Legal and others. The first step was  understanding the pain points of both breast cancer  patients and the medical professionals caring for them: 	• From a breast cancer patient’s perspective,  it can be overwhelming tracking down latest  information on clinical trials they can join to  potentially save their life whilst dealing with an  unforgiving illness. 	• From a medical professional’s perspective,  there is a challenge in finding suitable  candidates that will ultimately determine the  success of their trial.  With the help of the Nelune Foundation, Optus was  able to conduct interviews with breast cancer patients,  medical oncologists and trial coordinators to map out  their needs, concerns and questions. As a result, the  Optus team, working closely with renowned cancer  researchers, developed this breast cancer clinical  trial matching platform. The customer journey was  specifically designed by the Optus Customer Experience  volunteers to address all user-identified paint points.  The prototype created by the Optus volunteers and  Tech Mahindra creates a simple and easy online  portal where breast cancer patients can answer a few  questions which are used to match them to clinical  trials based on an up to date and single source of  Australian clinical trials.

We encourage our people to contribute  their time, skills, knowledge and ideas to help make  a difference to the lives of people and communities  around Australia, and the world.  We give each employee up to five days of volunteer  leave per year where they can participate in skilled or  non-skilled volunteer opportunities. Using the online  platform yes4good, we enable employees to choose  from more than 250 charities to support via donations,  fundraising or volunteering. We match employees’  donations and fundraising up to $300 per person  per year. An example of the impact our volunteering can achieve  is our support for Share the Dignity #itsinthebag,  a charity which helps vulnerable and at-risk women,  teenagers and mothers with newborns in Australia  by providing bags filled with essential items. Optus  employees donated to Share the Dignity via the  yes4good platform and during the Christmas period in  2019 our staff from corporate offices and retail stores  volunteered their time to prepare 527 bags, with 300  of these being freighted directly to bushfire‑affected  communities in NSW. Optus matched our people’s  donations to this charity for November and December,  with the overall campaign generating a contribution  of $90,000, consisting of time, in-kind and cash  donations. Another example is our support of The Smith Family  (TSF) Toy and Book Appeal. For Christmas 2019, 40  employees nationally volunteered by packing gift packs  and delivering packs to families identified by TSF. With  our help, more than 27,000 children received gifts.  We were proud to be recognised by Good Company in  2019 for being one of the best workplaces in Australia  for giving back. We also encourage our customers to get involved,  through programs such as Donate Your Data, or  through nominating schools to participate in our   Digital Citizenship programs. As well as amplifying our impact, involving our  people helps to keep them motivated and engaged  in their work.

Better Together is held in four destinations: India,  Thailand, the Philippines and an Indigenous Australia  experience. Participants apply to join the program  and are selected based on their demonstration of  engagement in community programs.  In FY20, 17 Optus people joined with colleagues from  Singtel Group in India and northern Australia. The Indigenous Australia team spent a week in the  Northern Territory working on a range of projects in  both urban and regional communities and learning  about Aboriginal heritage and culture. The team had  a deeply immersive Indigenous experience. The Better Together Australia team raised more than  $6,000 for the Balunu Foundation which will fund a  Healing Camp for Aboriginal youth at risk or impacted  by suicide to reconnect with their culture. The Better Together India team split into smaller teams  with a mix from each company and were allocated  to either a primary or secondary school, visiting four  schools in Amristar supporting approximately 2,000  students. Our people supported the local teachers  in lessons including General Knowledge, English,  Mathematics, Hygiene, Sport, and Environment.

Through GoFundMe pages, bake sales and  raffles, the team raised over $12,000. Mentoring programs  One of the most impactful ways to change young  people’s lives is through mentoring. It’s also a superb  opportunity for our people to practice new skills  such as coaching. A number of our programs and  partnerships, such as Pathways 2 Employment and the  ABCN, provide opportunities for our people to develop  their skills in leadership, diversity awareness, coaching  and mentoring.

As well as Optus volunteers for event  organisation, a team of six Optus riders used their  volunteering days and annual leave to participate. It  was a cold and wet 13 days for the riders and support  crew with mornings as cold as minus four degrees and  strong headwinds along the way, but they persevered  and enjoyed the spectacular scenery. Along the way  the riders visited local communities in Shepparton  and Geelong, speaking to over 5,000 school kids and  showing them how to ‘Be Fit, Be Healthy, Be Happy’  to set up good habits for life and help reduce the risks  of cancer.

We set out to achieve this through continued  development of our innovative diversity and inclusion  programs, our wellbeing culture and a focus on  equipping our people for the workplace of the future.  Operating in an industry sector where technology skills  are highly sought-after, we know that we need to offer  a great working life in order to be competitive.  With more than 7,000 team members throughout  Australia, we believe that by encouraging people  to bring their whole selves to work, we foster  improved employee satisfaction. This in turn powers  a better experience for our customers and greater  productivity. The success of this approach is reflected  in our voluntary turnover rate for employees of 15%  (compared to 17% in FY19), and our most recent  employee engagement performance.  27 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW THE BEST EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS OUR GREATEST ASSET  ===== PAGE 28 ===== total training investment 309 people completed an  Intelligent Automation  training course 80% Our employee sentiment  score from our annual  employee engagement  survey Your Voice   increased by 8  points to  38 new Optus Talent  Ambassadors Optus became a  Workplace Gender  Equality Agency (WGEA)  Pay Equity Ambassador  average training  hours per  employee Introduced a  campaign about  mutual respect for  our staff and  customers Our People  Highlights  for FY20 Our annual employee engagement survey, Your Voice,  provides us with vital information to shape our people’s  working experience.

Our employees are telling us that  they feel supported by their immediate managers  and colleagues, their colleagues are inclusive, they  appreciate work-life balance and that they continue   to see meaning in our brand and values. We support our people with: 	• Comprehensive workplace health, safety and  wellbeing programs and practices 	• Talent development and skills training  	• Opportunities to be involved in supporting  causes that they are passionate about 	• A strong focus on diversity and inclusion,  extending to gender, LGBTIQ+, cultural, age,  and to people with a disability 28 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW THE BEST EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS OUR GREATEST ASSET  ===== PAGE 29 ===== At Optus, health, safety and wellbeing are built  into how we operate. We pride ourselves on mutual  respect and supporting our staff to provide a safe  and inclusive space for customers, colleagues and  the community. Our goal is to continuously improve our performance in  preventing workplace-related injuries. Our workplace  injury frequency rate in FY20 has reduced to 1.2  compared to 1.3 in FY19. Our workplace fatality rate  remained at 0 in FY20, and the absenteeism rate was  maintained at 0.017. Here’s what we are doing: Employee wellness The mental health and wellness of our teams is front  of mind for Optus; our front-line staff can be impacted  by stressful customer resolution experiences and our  technicians sometimes complete hazardous work  to ensure the network operates smoothly. During  FY20 Optus introduced a public position of mutual  respect in support of our frontline workers in response  to increasing levels of customer intimidation and  aggression. We shifted from a position that ‘the  customer is always right’, to one of ‘mutual respect’. As part of this approach we launched a poster  campaign, signature block messaging, and stickers for  work vehicles, offered training to our people, and added  scripting to our call centre scripts to support consistent  responses to our customers. We also amended our  postpaid contracts to include clauses allowing service  suspension or termination for poor customer behaviour,  depending upon the extent and repetition of the  behaviour of our customers.  The feedback from our people has been one of  overwhelming gratitude that Optus has taken such a  public and consistent stance, whilst retaining a focus on  exceptional customer experience. We believe in creating a safe, inclusive and healthy  workplace, and recognising and promoting good  mental health has a significant role in this. Leaders  and employees are integral in creating a safe work  environment, one that doesn’t create or exacerbate  mental health problems and where employees  with mental illness are properly supported. To raise  awareness of this, we launched two e-learning courses  in FY20 – ‘Mental health in your workplace’ (for all  employees) and ‘Managing mental health in your  workplace’ (for people leaders). We also partnered with our Employee Assistance Plan  provider to run monthly wellbeing webinars in FY20.  These information sessions focus on various wellbeing  topics such as mindfulness, mental health – how to  have the conversation, resilience, getting a good nights’  sleep and managing pressure.  Health and Safety  Always #1 Respect goes both ways campaign poster We believe in creating  a safe, inclusive and  healthy workplace,  and recognising and  promoting good mental  health has a significant  role in this. 29 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW THE BEST EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS OUR GREATEST ASSET  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Health and safety In FY20, we were audited and successfully re‑certified  to AS4801, the Australian Standard for Safety  Management. The certification demonstrates that  Optus continues to meet a high standard of safety  management systems. During FY21 we will continue  to maintain our certification to AS4801 and then  transition to a new International Standard for  Safety Management, ISO:45001. We were again  successfully audited by the Office of the Federal  Safety Commissioner (OFSC) in late 2019 to confirm  our compliance with their regulatory expectations  associated with the use of Australian Federal  Government funding, for example in projects such   as Black Spot. Contractor safety management To sustain the health of our network across all of  Australia, we employ contractors to supplement our  workforce when required. They make up 2.3% of our  workforce. We see our contractors as part of the Optus  family, and support their safety and wellbeing just as  we do our employees.  In November 2019, we were successfully audited by the  Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner to meet  compliance expectations associated with Australian  Federal Government funding. As part of our safety management we established an  HSE Critical Incident Hotline for immediate reporting  of serious safety incidents by contractors and staff.  This is to enable prompt and accurate reporting of  serious incidents that may need to be communicated  immediately to our Australian safety regulator  (Comcare) to meet legislative timeframes.  For more details on Optus’ health and safety targets  and progress, visit the Singtel Group Sustainability  Report. Health and Safety Always #1 (continued) 30 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW THE BEST EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS OUR GREATEST ASSET  ===== PAGE 31 ===== We operate in a highly-skilled and highly-competitive  industry where our success depends in great part on  the skills, knowledge and enthusiasm of our people.  To maintain a healthy and engaged team we need to  invest in training and development that is relevant and  innovative, and also to focus on the mix of skills and  knowledge our people will need to equip them for the  future of work. To enable our staff to be future-ready we have  developed four key learning pillars: 	• Compliance 	• Company 	• Business  	• Future These programs focus on personal effectiveness,  leadership and technical and functional areas that  support our strategic priorities and business needs,  such as cloud services, analytics, cyber security and  smart cities. Our Graduate Program had over 1,700 applicants,  and in FY21 we will be onboarding 40 new graduates  to begin our two-year program, working across our  various business units – particularly in areas with skill  shortages. To round out our attraction strategy, we  launched a Talent Ambassador Program, to encourage  employee advocacy for Optus careers including the  voice of our people through #OptusLife on social  media platforms.  The Best Talent Optus graduates at our campus in Sydney Optus graduates at our campus in Sydney 31 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW THE BEST EXPERIENCE THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS OUR GREATEST ASSET  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Talent Ambassador Program In the highly-competitive tech world, Optus needed  a strategy to market careers in a way that would  attract top talent and compete with Australia’s largest  technology firms. With 4.5 million monthly active users  in Australia, LinkedIn is one of the most widely used  social media platforms for career-related content.  Research shows that on LinkedIn, employee generated  content goes significantly further than company  generated content and that companies with socially- engaged employees are more likely to attract and  retain top talent. Leveraging these insights, we  developed the Optus Talent Ambassador Program, a  bespoke program that inspires our people to celebrate,  promote, and showcase their career at Optus on  LinkedIn through a united hashtag, #OptusLife.  To be considered for the program, Ambassadors had to  submit an application answering various questions on  why they’d be suited to the program and why they felt  passionate about Optus as an employer. From more  than 100 applications in two weeks, we chose a diverse  group of 38 Ambassadors.  Ambassadors received a full-day training session  to get to know each other and received training on  social media marketing skills to help them share their  #OptusLife story. To recognise our Ambassadors, we  gifted them Optus Talent Ambassador jackets as a  symbol of their efforts in promoting Optus careers and  each month they benefit from a tailored training and  development program to evolve their personal brand  and social media marketing skills.  Since October 2019, the program has: 	• Generated 1.1 million organic views from  #OptusLife posts (saving over $150,000 in  advertising costs) 	• Given a 356% uplift in LinkedIn company  pageviews in the first 30 days of the program 	• Contributed to a 17% increase in candidate  applicants in October and November 2019,  compared to October and November 2018 	• Reduced the average number of days to fill  roles company-wide from 43 to 36 days year- on-year. Our Talent Ambassador Program was recognised as a  global case study showcasing LinkedIn’s best-in-class  approach to recruitment marketing on the platform.

A2E Essentials helps us develop a shared skill  set and common language focusing on accountability,  effectiveness, and clear communication. During  FY20, everyone in our Australian Consumer business  completed the program, either face-to-face or online. Singtel Group Learning Fiesta A centrepiece of our training and engagement program  this year was the Singtel Group Learning Fiesta. Optus  ran 45 different courses and events over 75 sessions in a  two-month period during October and November. These  were offered both as face to face sessions and online  streaming sessions, and we made sure our people were  given the opportunity and time to attend sessions. The  Fiesta was a success with nearly 1,400 people taking  part. 86% of those who participated said they were  very glad to have attended the sessions and would  recommend the learning to another team member.  Future of work Innovation and change are a constant in our industry  and we want our staff to be able to thrive in the  workplace of the future. To support this aim, in FY20  we continued our ‘Career Agility’ platform, a platform  which helps individuals assess, develop and plan their  careers in preparation for the future of work. The  platform is a two-way exchange where activities,  conversation and information are shared with our  people about the future of work and what it means  for them.  Focus on automation Automation is one of the key technologies powering  the next-generation at Optus. It’s clear that  Intelligent Automation, a combination of Robotic  Process Automation (RPA) and Artificial Intelligence  (AI) technologies, is a crucial accelerator of digital  transformation and we continue to develop our strong  capabilities in these fields.  Launched in 2018, the Optus Automation Academy  is a capability development program that will upskill  our people for future technical and non-technical  automation roles. This ground-breaking program put  us on track to become one of the first official Robotic  Process Automation (RPA) training partners and  reference facilities in the Southern Hemisphere. In FY20, more than 300 people attended an Intelligent  Automation course through our iAutomate Centre of  Excellence (iAutomate CoE).  This year, to centralise our RPA practice, iAutomate  CoE, IT and our RPA teams across Consumer, Optus  Wholesale and Networks, set up a new Robotics  Operation Centre (ROC) to monitor, govern, operate  and support our digital workforce of more than  150 RPA bots, ensuring our automation practice is  sustainable, adheres to regulation and policies, and  meets our evolving needs.

Eight teams worked to solve problems aimed at  improving customer experience and their working  life – making the technology work for them and our  customers. Some examples include:  	• The Talent Acquisition team aimed to use  automation to help them and their leaders  recruit talent more effectively. TARA (Talent  Acquisition Robot Assistant) will scan  thousands of resumes for keywords and  phrases to allow categorization, allowing  the team to deal with people more than  paperwork.  	• Focused on improving customer experience  for orders that may need extra attention, the  Supply Chain team built a Bot to check stock  levels to support speedy customer deliveries.  	• The Optus Business Client Services team built  “RobotSmith”, a virtual contact centre agent  able to log into our Optus Business customers’  managed environments, and confirm they are  functioning as expected, or then alert the team  to issues before they occur. This enables the  team’s engineers to focus on more complex  tasks. Our Indigenous talent   pipeline in Australia Optus has been partnering with CareerTrackers with  a combined purpose of achieving the best outcomes  for Australia’s vulnerable communities, including  Indigenous Australians, while also enhancing our  talent pipeline.  CareerTrackers is a national non‑profit organisation  supporting the long-term career aspirations of  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander University  students. CareerTrackers links students with employers  to prepare students for success at university, their  chosen profession and in their respective communities.  In FY2019 we welcomed three Indigenous Interns to  Optus offering them 12-week paid internships via  the partnership.

We believe that an inclusive culture,  where you can be yourself at work, forges stronger  connections with our customers and drives innovation.  We have made strides towards greater inclusion and  diversity, but we know there’s still more work to be  done to ensure our workforce truly reflects the mix of  ages, cultures, gender and other indicators of diversity  in our community. Our goal is that our people feel  included within their teams and that we have a mix of  people with varying perspectives and experiences that  represent the community we aim to serve. Our Inclusion Strategy sets out to derive value for  our business and customers by focusing on diversity  of thought. Inclusivity is a key ingredient in creativity  and innovation that makes Optus a successful  ‘Challenger’ brand.  We do this through: 	• Encouraging our people to be themselves   by expressing their unique identity 	• Having a voice to contribute ideas and  different ways of solving problems and  challenges  	• Empowering our people and energising them  of what is possible To provide focus and derive real value from an inclusive  workplace, we have identified a number of enablers  and initiatives.  Here’s what we are doing: Optus Diversity and Inclusion Council This internal council was established in 2019 to  strengthen our position as a leading employer, by  providing focus and advocacy for priorities to deliver  on our Inclusion Strategy and drive innovation through  diversity of thought. The Council is chaired by an  executive leader and comprised of senior leaders  representing different business units. The initial focus  of the Council is to provide insight and input to achieve  greater inclusivity leading to an increase in female  representation, working towards gender balance. Gender Diversity Optus is committed to creating a gender‑inclusive  workplace. In 2020, Optus became a Workplace   Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) Pay Equity   Ambassador pledging to promote and improve  gender equality.   A Diverse and  Inclusive Workplace Our Inclusion Strategy  sets out to derive value  for our business and  customers by focusing  on diversity of thought.

To support this, we forged a  partnership with WISE Employment to attract talent  and refreshed our Accessibility & Inclusion Action Plan.  We also worked in consultation with our people to  understand what is required to design and fit-out our  premises (starting with our Sydney Campus) to ensure  that they are in line with the latest access standards  and technology.  Key initiatives delivered this year include:  	• Disability Confident Recruiter training for our  Talent Acquisition Team 	• A partnership established with WISE  Employment (a Disability Confident  Recruitment company) 	• The purchase and launch of a Disability  Confident Manager e-learning module for  people leaders 	• An upgrade of our compliance training modules  in an accessible format for our people  	• The introduction of an external mentoring  program (PACE mentoring) with the Australian  Network on Disability, where we had five senior  Optus leaders mentor job seekers In FY21 we will continue to action the recommendations  from the Access and Inclusion Index to connect with our  diverse customers and create business value.

Inclusive Australia wants to make exclusion and  discrimination a thing of the past by bringing people  together, changing current attitudes, and starting to  celebrate our diversity as a strength. As an outcome,  we believe social and economic burden can be lessened.  A key feature of the Inclusive Australia initiative is  building an alliance of supporting organisations,  committed to a common vision: an inclusive Australia  where all people feel they belong and are valued,  and difference is respected and celebrated. Alliance  members are growing and include Australia Post,  PwC, Coles, Paralympics Australia, Special Olympics  Australia and more. Like Inclusive Australia, Optus shares the vision of  ‘connection builds empathy’ and ‘let’s start celebrating  diversity as a strength’. By embracing our differences,  we positively impact our customers and society to help  people feel they belong.  Our Chairman Paul O’Sullivan and immediate past  CEO Allen Lew co-signed Inclusive Australia’s pledge  to show our commitment, and Optus hosted Inclusive  Australia’s Official Sydney Launch at our Optus Sydney  Campus in December 2019. We will continue to actively show our support. As a  well-known Australian brand, we have the power to  reach large audiences and promote social inclusion  through our people, programs and our collaboration  with others.

These laws  cover rules governing the collection, use, disclosure   and care of personal data. During FY20, we proactively probed our complaint  online tracker database to check if any complaints  should have been directed to our Data Protection  Office. From our active search, we picked up 250   customer data related incidents, caused mainly due  to staff error and negligence, and mostly affecting  individuals. As well as taking our own actions to protect  data and privacy, we are also active in supporting  customers, and young people in particular, to keep  themselves safe online (refer to the Digital Citizenship  section). Additionally, we participate in Privacy  Awareness Week (PAW), an annual initiative to raise  awareness of privacy issues and the importance of  protecting personal information.  Leveraging technology  Innovation and problem solving We’re constantly innovating to find ways to give our  customers the best experience with us. We listen to  customer feedback and we aim to meet and exceed  customer expectations.  An example of this approach comes from our new  digital messaging service. We launched this service to  enable customers to interact with Optus, not have to  repeat their enquiry history, and then go about their  lives while Optus solves their problem. Optus Messaging is the latest ‘always-on’ help and  support channel and is available through My Optus app  and online via My Account. Optus Messaging provides  a 24/7 direct line of communication with Optus care  teams where customers can ‘come and go’ from a  conversation at their own pace and convenience. Unique to Messaging, this service facilitates a  conversational-style approach between Optus  customers and care support teams by drawing  on the latest technologies to blend digital and  human experiences.

In FY20, our 5G rollout ramped up considerably, with  740 active 5G sites now available to our customers at  the end of March 2020. We’ve also claimed a number  of firsts, teaming up with Ericsson to deliver Australia’s  first 5G tele-operated drone controlled over a live 5G  network, and successfully made an end-to-end 5G video  call whilst simultaneously streaming video content on a  5G device. The international video call was made using  the Optus 5G network in Australia and Singtel’s pilot  5G network in Singapore.

Using a spectrum radio analyser, which  measures radio signals in the 420MHz  and 6GHz frequency range, Dr Knipe  measured the radio signals from our 5G base  station outdoors and indoors with other  wireless devices including microwave ovens,  baby monitors and a 5G mobile phone. Using  the Australian Radiation Protection and  Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) that test  safety limits, Dr Knipe found that readings on  the various devices and the 5G base station  were well within ARPANSA standards.  The demonstration showed:  	• Two-way radio and microwave came in  at 0.09% of ARPANSA’s safe limits 	• 5G when outdoors at 0.025%  	• A baby monitor at 0.001%  	• 5G radio signal when indoors only  reached 0.0001% of the safe limits 41 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW OUR GREATEST ASSET THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS THE BEST EXPERIENCE  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Customer hardship support Optus understands that unexpected events can  arise which are beyond the control of our customers.  When customers approach us in difficulty, we aim  to understand their circumstances, review possible  solutions and offer a tailored approach for each  customer. We aim to enable customers experiencing  difficult circumstances to keep connected to essential  services, their family and friends, and have access to  income support and other assistance facilities. A specialised team looks after vulnerable customers,  including those affected by:  	• Natural disasters 	• Domestic/family violence 	• Mental health 	• Death in the family 	• Family breakdown/separation 	• Substance dependency 	• Incarceration and  	• Gambling Team members are trained to be able to identify and  assist these customers, and work with them to create  win-win solutions for both Optus and the customer.  Protecting customers’ privacy is also paramount. We’re always trying to ensure our approach meets  evolving better practice, and we’ve set up mechanisms  to seek feedback from external agencies and customer  advocates. We also participate in key conferences  and workshops to obtain feedback, ideas and develop  opportunities to work collaboratively to provide the  best customer assistance.  Enhancing network reliability and coverage We continue to enhance our networks and  infrastructure to support the digital transition  underway in businesses, schools and universities and  homes across Australia. We expect the COVID-19  situation to accelerate this transition.  Our total Network Investment was $1.1 billion in FY20.  Of this, we invested $905 million in our mobile network  and $303 million of this was to extend our coverage  and capacity capabilities within our regional network.  As well as delivering these big infrastructure projects,  we have steadily improved coverage, investing in new  mobile phone towers, mainly in regional areas where  ‘communication blackspots’ have impacted network  reliability. This sustained program of investment,  delivered in partnership with Federal and State  Governments, will underpin the digital future   for Australia’s regions. Product service and safety To ensure our technology performs well above safety  standards, we conduct audits of base stations and  undertake predictive Electro Magnetic Energy (EME)  modelling and testing to ensure compliance at our  sites with the Australian standards. We experienced no  reportable EME incidents during FY20 and publish the  EME reports of all our sites at www.rfnsa.com.au.

The program is open to start-ups, social entrepreneurs  and not-for-profit organisations who already have  a minimum viable product out in the market. It  enables shortlisted applicants to advance their  technology‑based solution and build their start-up,  social impact and tech expertise, with an opportunity  to gain investment to scale their business and  their impact.  In FY20 we introduced a shared value stream to the  program with the aim of finding opportunities for our  alumni and Optus stakeholders to work together. As a  result, a pilot program was developed with 2017 alumni,  Commsync and Brisbane City Council to give a safety  watch to at-risk children and youth to help keep them  safe in family violence scenarios. We also participated in the annual Singtel Group  Future Makers program, held in Singapore in June 2019  in collaboration with the Asia Venture Philanthropy  Network. Ten selected finalists from across Singtel,  Optus, and regional Associates AIS, Globe and  Telkomsel had the opportunity to pitch for funding,  learn from thought leaders during the conference,  collaborate with fellow Future Makers and scale their  solutions in the region with a total grant pool   of $100,000 from Singtel.  The two Optus Future Makers representatives were  Equal Reality and Virtual Psychologist, with both  receiving funding to expand their offerings in the Asia  Pacific region. In particular, Virtual Psychologist, a  text-based counselling service, is currently undertaking  a pilot program with Globe in the Philippines to  roll out its services to more than 200 schools and  380,000 students.

We are committed to strong corporate governance,  business ethics and transparency, and have a zero- tolerance policy towards fraud, corruption and  unethical actions. We are subject to several legislative and regulatory  requirements and we seek to comply with them; we  check our compliance regularly and if there are any  breaches, we seek to understand what has happened,  rectify the matter and modify our practices. At a Group level we have policies on Anti-Bribery  and Corruption and Fraud Investigation. These are  underpinned by a Code of Conduct for our people  and a Whistleblower Hotline.  In early 2019, the Australian Parliament passed  legislation that requires large organisations to  maintain a whistleblower service and to comply with  provisions concerning protection of whistleblowers that  make certain types of disclosure. We are currently  reviewing the Optus hotline and the Singtel  Group Whistleblower Policy to ensure that they meet  the requirements of the legislation.  In FY20 there were 108 cases reported to our  Whistleblower Hotline including 29 substantiated cases.   Fair and responsible marketing At Optus, we’re committed to providing our customers  with game-changing experiences. This can only be  achieved through delivering to the customer what  was advertised. Having accurate and customer  friendly communications that enable our customers  to understand what is being offered and meet their  expectations is critical. We evaluate our performance via the number of  communications related incidents (errors), regulatory  enforcement and customer satisfaction. This year we  were fined for two breaches involving marketing material.  In December 2019, the Australian Competition and  Consumer Commission (ACCC) fined Optus $6.4  million for misleading claims about home internet  disconnections to consumers. We offered customers  a cost-free exit from contracts signed due to such  claims. We were also fined $504,000 in January 2020  by the Australian Communications and Media Authority  (ACMA) for breaching spam laws. We apologised to  our customers and took prompt action to address  the issues. As a result, we undertook an independent  review of our systems and processes in our Australian  operations to report on the management of marketing  communications, including approval of marketing  and advertising copy. The report found there were no  revisions or rectifications reasonably necessary for  Optus to make to its compliance program, or legal  processes, to limit the risk of future contraventions  of the Australian Consumer Law. Ethical and Responsible  Practices 44 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW OUR GREATEST ASSET THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS THE BEST EXPERIENCE  ===== PAGE 45 ===== A responsible supply chain In FY20, Optus transacted with over 1,150 diverse  suppliers, including commercial third party  relationships. Our supplier base covers several  categories, the largest of which are devices,  construction, networks, information technology,  marketing and advisory services.  We are on a journey to creating a responsible and  sustainable supply chain and this year we took  significant steps towards that goal. These include: 	• Updating our Group Supplier Code of Conduct  and incorporating labour and environmental  clauses within our Master Services Agreement 	• A gap analysis to identify areas of  improvement within our supply chain processes 	• Commencing a risk assessment of our active  supplier base to identify environmental and  social risks such as risks of human rights or  labour practice abuses 	• Developing a three-year program of action to  enhance our supply chain risk management  We ask all our suppliers to confirm that they abide by  the Optus Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets out  the standards we expect of them, including respect  for human rights and the environment. We also plan  to refine our Supplier Self-Assessment questionnaire  which all new suppliers are expected to complete.  Human Rights As a signatory of the UN Global Compact since  2007, we’re committed to upholding its ten principles  including human rights and labour issues. The UN  Universal Declaration of Human Rights and UN Guiding  Principles on Business and Human Rights also guide  our approach and policy development to help us better  assess, mitigate and combat modern slavery impact  in our operations and supply chain. We respect and  support the human rights of individuals regardless of  who they are, and where they live.  We are currently  undertaking a supplier risk assessment of our suppliers  in order to better understand our salient risks and how  we can mitigate modern slavery in our supply chain.   With the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act  2018 (MSA) in Australia, the Group Master Services  Agreement (GMSA) has been reviewed and updated  to incorporate the MSA requirements. As well, we’re  developing a Human Rights Policy and a Modern  Slavery statement that will be published at the end  of 2020. Our Supplier Code of Conduct has also been  updated incorporating measures addressing labour and  human rights. It will be communicated to suppliers at  the commencement of new tender processes to ensure  they understand the expectations for working with the  Singtel Group. Indigenous suppliers To improve our engagement with Indigenous  organisations and to identify Indigenous partnership  opportunities, Optus has renewed its partnership with  Supply Nation, and an Optus Indigenous Working Party  was formed this year. The Working Party aims to plan  the Indigenous strategy across both Optus Business  and Consumer, which includes raising awareness,  creating volunteer opportunities, a robust procurement  plan, and involvement in the education programs for  Indigenous youth.   Ethical and Responsible Practices (continued) Our NAIDOC Week market stalls at our campus in Sydney 45 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW OUR GREATEST ASSET THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT ADDRESSING THE SDGS THE BEST EXPERIENCE  ===== PAGE 46 ===== We’re taking action to leave the smallest  environmental footprint possible, even while our  business and networks continue to grow. That includes  working to reduce our environmental impacts and to  consider potential environmental consequences across  our value chain, including our business operations,  suppliers and customers. Our Environment Policy  outlines our preventative approach and commitment  to the environment.  The key elements of our policy are: 	• A commitment to understanding, managing  and minimising the environmental impact  of our business operations, products and  supply chain 	• Continually improving our environmental  performance and minimising impact through  resource and energy management, pollution  prevention and biodiversity protection 	• Managing our carbon footprint and energy  consumption through use of technology,  process improvements, energy optimisation  and other efficiency measures 	• Adopting plans and measures throughout  our operations and infrastructure to adapt  to and build resilience to the longer-term risks  of climate change. Our environmental footprint consists mainly of the  carbon emissions generated by electricity consumption  across our network, the waste associated with the  packaging of our products as well as the disposal of the  devices we sold when they reach their end of life (EoL).  46 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW OUR GREATEST ASSET THE BEST EXPERIENCE ADDRESSING THE SDGS THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Net Zero Committed to keeping global  temperature increases within 1.5°C  above pre-industrial levels by 2100  and reach Our electricity intensity (kWh/TB)  continues to decrease with a new  record low of  Achieved “leading” performance  score in the Australian Packaging  Covenant Organisation (APCO)  assessment for calendar 2019  emissions by 2050 133 kWh/TB  (compared to 160 in FY19) Decreased carbon intensity  to a new record low of  0.1 ton CO2e/TB  Diverted 3,728 kg of e-waste or handsets, batteries and  accessories from landФill 51,544 We kept our communities and  emergency services connected during  the Black Summer last year and  implemented new ways to increase the  resilience of our infrastructure using  innovative approaches Our Smallest Footprint  Highlights for FY20 47 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW OUR GREATEST ASSET THE BEST EXPERIENCE ADDRESSING THE SDGS THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT  ===== PAGE 48 ===== We manage the impact of climate change proactively  because this enables us to serve our customers when  they need it most. For example, when extreme weather  events affect our communities (e.g. bushfires), having  resilient telecommunications infrastructure is vital  to continue providing a critical service, ensuring  families can stay in touch with their loved ones and  emergency services are able to coordinate rescue and  relief operations. We’re also working to improve our  energy efficiency and exploring ways to power our  infrastructure with renewable energy to minimise our  carbon footprint. In July 2019, Optus and Singtel were part of a  pioneering group of 28 global companies to commit to  climate targets in alignment to the Paris Agreement.  This group of companies is committed to keeping  global temperature increases well below 2°C above  pre‑industrial levels by 2100. We have strengthened our  contribution by moving towards a net-zero emissions  organisation by 2050.  Climate change is a risk to businesses worldwide  and we’re striving to communicate the impacts to  our business arising from climate change risks by  benchmarking our progress towards the full disclosure  of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. Since 2017  we have progressively disclosed more information in  relation to climate risks in our sustainability reports  and continue to improve the incorporation of climate  risks into decision making.

It’s critical  for us to review current and new climate related risks  and trends in many regions of Australia that are prone  to major cyclones and other natural disasters so we can  take the necessary steps to prepare and respond to   these risks.  At a policy and research level, we contribute as  a founding member of the Australian Business  Roundtable for Disaster Resilience and Safer  Communities (ABR). ABR’s recommendations  to Government have been recognised through  development of Australia’s National Disaster Risk  Reduction (NDRR) Framework, launched in April 2019.  Through ABR we will continue to be actively involved  in the National Disaster Risk Reduction (NDRR)  Industry Advisory Forum, to shape implementation of  the Framework. At an operational level, we’re continuing to invest in  equipment and resources that enable a more effective  response to natural disasters and emergencies.  Our disaster management fleet utilises SATCATS  (a Satellite Cell on a trailer that uses satellite  transmissions for coverage in a limited range, without  the need for infrastructure). During calendar 2019 our  Operations Team explored the use of rapid deployment  mobile solutions for disaster management and as  a result, our current fleet of four SATCATS may  be complemented by an additional investment of  $1.5 million on small cells. Small cells are lighter, easier  to transport, provide instant access to the 4G platform  and are cheaper than SATCATS. This investment will  strengthen our disaster response capabilities by rapidly  deploying mobile coverage solutions to affected zones.

Since then, we have worked across our  business to identify the impacts to the business  arising from extreme weather events such as cyclones,  bushfires and floods. Identifying climate risks requires  developing scenarios associated with transitional  (related to moving to a low-carbon economy) and  physical risks. We are actively continuing to improve  our understanding and disclosure of these risks in our  annual reports. After identifying the different physical, transitional  and liability risks in our organisation and updating our  corporate risk register, we began engagement with risk  modelling experts to further refine our understanding  of the impact of extreme weather events and  incorporate them into our business planning processes.  We have also begun to scope our next steps which  include linking the physical risk modelling results to  the financial data to validate how material these  indicators are to Optus/Singtel’s long-term financial  performance. A targeted area within our Australian  network has been identified as the most suitable  for physical risk modelling purposes and to help us  better understand the variety of interdependencies  with different stakeholders within the business as  we continue improving our disclosures as part of our  TCFD journey.  Please visit the TCFD website for more information  about their framework.  Science Based Targets (SBT) Science Based Targets are environmental best  practice and use climate science to set GHG emissions  reduction targets. We were the first Australian  telecommunications company to adopt such targets  and get them approved in 2017. Optus/Singtel is  committed to reducing our scope 1 and 2 emissions  by 42% and scope 3 emissions by 30% between 2015  and 2030.  In February 2020, the first science-based,  sector‑specific decarbonisation pathway to reduce  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in alignment to the  1.5˚C report, across the global telecommunications  sector was announced. We supported this pathway  from the very beginning and actively contributed with  the SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative), GSMA  (the global mobile operators’ industry body), ITU  (International Telecommunication Union) and GeSI  (Global e-Sustainability Initiative) to make it a reality.

Our product stewardship approach considers the  impact of our products and services before products  reach our stores, during our operations and activities  and after their useful life. Our most significant impacts  are in the packaging used for mobile phones and other  electronic equipment that we sell, and the waste  generated by our operations and our products. Our waste streams include End of Life devices, waste  associated with the expansion of our network, product  packaging waste and municipal waste generation  associated with the operation of our stores and offices.  We have a range of initiatives in place to manage each  of these waste streams, with a focus on reducing and  recycling our own waste, collaborating with partners  and suppliers, and redesigning our product offerings to  minimise our impact in this area. In FY20 we enhanced these efforts by: 	• Improving our performance against Australia’s  packaging framework to be recognised as  ‘leading’ by the Australian Packaging Covenant  Organisation (APCO) 	• Consolidating our Sustainable Packaging  Strategy into ten targets for the period  2019-2021 and aligning it to our aspirational  target to make all packaging 100% re-usable,  recyclable or compostable by 2025 	• Working closely with our waste management  supplier to reduce the amount of waste sent  to landfill by more than half from our previous  year and continue to explore ways to eliminate  disposal to landfill 	• Beginning the process of having our waste  management performance benchmarked using  the NABERS national rating system 	• Initiating supply chain sustainability risk  assessment together with Singtel Product Stewardship 53 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW OUR GREATEST ASSET THE BEST EXPERIENCE ADDRESSING THE SDGS THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT  ===== PAGE 54 ===== Here’s what we are doing: Sustainable packaging Sustainable packaging has a direct and indirect  contribution in our environmental impact across  the value chain, from resource utilisation, product  packaging all the way to the generation of different  waste streams.  Optus’ Sustainable Packaging Goals were initially  developed in FY19 and progressively refined during  FY20 into a set of ten clear and concise targets. The  targets outline sustainable packaging goals around  weight reduction and optimisation, recyclability and  recoverability of materials, Australasian Recycling Label  (ARL) implementation, waste diversion from landfill,  and other key improvement areas. With Australian environmental ministers agreeing on  an aspirational goal of having all packaging in Australia  either reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025, we  have aligned our approach with this goal. As part of  this journey, all foils, celloglaze and spot UV as well as  finishes that make packaging not recyclable have been  removed from our products this year. We have also  included the FSC and recycling logos on the reverse of  the packaging of all our prepaid SIM packaging. Finally,  we launched a new online training module accessible  to all Optus staff to support a range of sustainability  initiatives including sustainable packaging. We’re committed to the principles of the Australian  Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO), a  co‑regulatory, not-for-profit organisation partnering  government and industry to reduce the environmental  impact of packaging in Australian communities.  Our efforts were also recognised by the APCO award  for the Telecommunications category last year,  ranking us as a “Leading” Australian company in our  sustainable packaging efforts and best practices. In  calendar 2019 we achieved an APCO score of 72% (up  from 55% in 2018), which helped us to move from the  ‘Advanced’ to the ‘Leading’ category in sustainable  packaging in Australia. This is the third consecutive year we have been  awarded by APCO, as well as being recognised as a  high performing member since we joined in 2007.  APCO noted that Optus made significant  improvements in the areas of Consumer Engagement,  Packaging Design, Packaging Material Efficiency and  Business to Business Packaging.

When Finsbury Green  won Optus’s long-term print management contract,  their sustainability credentials played a large part in  the decision.  Partnering with Finsbury Green means that Optus  is working with one of the most sustainable printing  solutions providers in the world. At the front line  of this approach is the Finsbury Green Star Rating  System* (FGSR) that all of FG suppliers must complete  during the supplier accreditation process. FGSR is  an environmental evaluation protocol that actively  promotes sustainable practices within FG supply chain  and include the completion of an online questionnaire  resulting in a star rating and a calculated CO2 footprint  which are independently audited. This enables Optus  to ensure its second tier of suppliers adhere to the best  environmental performance metrics, so the positive  rippling effects move beyond our immediate interaction  with tier 1 suppliers.  55 HOME BCK FWD THE MOST CONNECTED COMMUNITIES OVERVIEW OUR GREATEST ASSET THE BEST EXPERIENCE ADDRESSING THE SDGS THE SMALLEST FOOTPRINT  ===== PAGE 56 ===== e-Waste management and recycling We actively support initiatives to reduce e-waste and  encourage recycling.  Australians are among the world’s highest users of  technology and produce around 25kg per person  of electronic waste each year. Recycling electronic  equipment such as mobile phones, enables consumers  and businesses to avoid future greenhouse gas  emissions, save energy, prevent potentially hazardous  materials from entering the environment and conserve  natural resources. In Australia, we recycle more than  98% of our own e-waste. Our initiatives include: 	• SIM card recycling — in calendar 2019 we  recycled 246,426 SIM cards as part of our SIM  expiry recall initiative, making a total of 4.29  tonnes of material diverted from landfill under  this intiative 	• Developing consumer education material on  the correct way to recycle Optus packaging  material 	• A program to recycle unwanted television set  top boxes. In calendar 2019 a total of 62,588  Fetch TV set top boxes were returned through  a postal drop off service, avoiding associated  courier packaging as well as transport  emissions 	• Mobile phone recycling in partnership with the  national Mobile Muster scheme, a national  industry-wide collaboration stewardship  scheme that allows customers to recycle their  old mobile phones at any Optus retail store 	• Through these efforts, we diverted 3,728 kg  of e-waste or 51,544 handsets, batteries and  accessories from landfill in Australia in FY20,  a slight decrease on FY19. The decrease mainly  comes from a drop in collections coming from  our stores and we have identified that there is  a significant opportunity to increase collections  by increasing the visibility of the program  within our stores Our efforts saved 8.3 tonnes of CO2 emissions  and conserved 42.2 tonnes of mineral resources.  Additionally, as part of the Mobile Muster program,  around 339kgs of packaging was collected through the  Mobile Muster for recycling.

Despite significant currency  headwinds, our FY2024 underlying  net profit was up 10% to S$2.26 billion,  buoyed also by higher interest income.  Net profit dropped 64% to S$795 million  on an exceptional loss of S$1.47 billion  due mainly to non-cash impairment  charges on goodwill and Optus  Enterprise’s fixed network assets.  The Group will pay an ordinary  dividend of 15.0 cents for FY2024 –  the third increase since the strategic  reset in FY2022. This includes a new  value realisation dividend of  3.8 cents, introduced to share the  rewards of our capital recycling  programme, by returning excess  capital to shareholders.   Lee Theng Kiat Chairman Yuen Kuan Moon Group Chief Executive Officer Three years ago,   we embarked on a  strategic reset to  transform the company  amid accelerated  digitalisation brought   on by COVID. Today,  Singtel’s composition  is radically different  – sharpened to focus  on the three key areas  of connectivity, digital  services and digital  infrastructure. Repositioned for growth  From strategic reset   to Singtel28     As Asia’s economic outlook brightens,  the stage is set for our next phase  of growth, for which the Group has  been well-primed. Three years ago,  we embarked on a strategic reset  to transform the company amid  accelerated digitalisation brought on  by COVID. Today, Singtel’s composition  is radically different – sharpened  to focus on the three key areas of  connectivity, digital services and digital  infrastructure. The Group has made  significant operational improvements  such as consolidating the consumer  and enterprise business units in both  Singapore and Australia, besides  executing to a proven capital recycling  programme that has unlocked   S$8 billion to support this reset.   Having restructured and delivered   our transformation at pace, we have  built a strong foundation from which to   move into our next phase of growth.  Singtel28 – a new strategy   for growth  While the reset was a strategy for  transformation, Singtel28 is a strategy  for growth that is premised on lifting  business performance and smart   capital management.  With the consolidation of the consumer  and enterprise businesses of Singtel  Singapore and Optus, the Group is  simplifying product offerings and  removing complexity for customers.  It will also reap greater synergies by  implementing leaner cost structures to  better compete and strengthen market  leadership. A recent network sharing deal  between Optus and TPG will drive capital  efficiency while improving services  for customers in regional Australia.  Enhancing customer experience remains  key and our innovations in areas such  as 5G network slicing, telco application  programming interfaces and Network- as-a-Service present new opportunities  for tangible differentiation.  Chairman and GCEO Message 06  ===== PAGE 9 ===== our core or growth businesses. Besides  the funding flexibility afforded by asset  recycling, partnering the right investors  on capital-intensive businesses will  bring patient capital for longer term  projects, valuable strategic expertise  and also help illuminate the value of  the ventures. Changed dividend policy and  sustained value realisation The dividend policy has been changed  to better reflect our new priorities. Core  dividends will track improvements in  business performance while a new  value realisation dividend has been  introduced to share the rewards from  our capital management programme  with shareholders after setting aside  funds for growth. This demonstrates  confidence in our performance and  outlook for cashflow and will allow us  to return excess capital to shareholders  in a sustained manner even as we keep  investing in growth. In November 2023,  the Group raised the payout range  of its core dividend to 70% and 90% of  underlying net profit.  Championing people   and sustainability  At the start of our strategic reset  three years back, we deepened  our commitment to put people  and sustainability at the heart of  our business. The Group has since  accelerated its commitment to climate  action, becoming Asia’s first telco to  bring forward its net-zero goal to 2045  and renew its science-based targets   with SBTi. Our interim target is to  lower 55% of scope 1 and 2 carbon  emissions and 40% of scope 3 by 2030.  This will be achieved by reducing  Our digital services arm NCS has scaled  meaningfully and secured S$3 billion  in bookings this past year, having  expanded its client base to the enterprise  sector and into the region. To support  this, it has grown its global delivery  network while investing in AI and tech  resiliency for clients as it continues to  scale at pace. Our data centre business  Nxera is poised to expand its operational  capacity from the existing 62MW to  over 200MW in the region in the next  three years, leveraging the fast-growing  adoption of AI. Bolstered by support   from international investment firm   KKR which took a 20% stake in the   new business, Nxera was valued at   S$5.5 billion in September 2023. In the regional associates’ markets,  the Group has repositioned for new  opportunities in the emerging area  of fixed broadband and mobile  convergence by integrating IndiHome  with Telkomsel in Indonesia and 3BB  with AIS in Thailand. We expect them  to continue capturing opportunities in  this under-penetrated space with their  sizeable mobile base providing cross- selling potential and cost synergies.  Smart capital management The Group will continue its smart capital  management, building on the successful  capital recycling programme that saw  S$8 billion unlocked over the past three  years. That was a key component of  our transformation as the proceeds  allowed us to fund growth, pay down  debt and return some of that capital  to shareholders. Going forward, a  further pipeline of around S$6 billion in  monetisable assets has been identified  to further support our growth initiatives  and new revenue streams such as   GPU-as-a-Service and our Paragon  edge-cloud orchestration platform.  We will keep tapping external capital  partners to jointly fund capital-intensive  growth engines such as KKR’s investment  in Nxera.  This strategy of recycling assets and  teaming with capital partners will help  us deploy capex sustainably – be it for  While the reset was a strategy for   transformation, Singtel28 is a strategy for growth   that is premised on lifting business performance   and smart capital management.

We would like to extend our  thanks to our staff and management for  staying the course and delivering to the  reset, readying the Group for changes  in the dynamic digital economy. Our  appreciation also goes to our fellow  directors for their guidance during  this time of transition. While the main  transformational work is over, there is still  more to do as we strive to deliver value  for our customers and shareholders and  keep doing good for our stakeholders.  We look forward to everyone’s continued  support on this journey.

Beyond transforming the business, our  proactive approach to managing capital has helped us  achieve better capital efficiency and a more optimal capital  structure. We unlocked S$8 billion of proceeds from our  capital management efforts.  This capital has been put to good use as we deployed it to  grow our data centre and ICT businesses. We also returned  S$0.8 billion in special dividends to shareholders. This is on  top of the S$5.6 billion in dividends declared, as we have  increased payouts every year since the start of the strategic  reset. Our balance sheet has also been strengthened  with net debt down by S$4.6 billion (1). This has seen a 15%  reduction in net interest expense in spite of a rising interest  rate environment. We are now in an even stronger position  to execute our disciplined capital approach of balancing  investing for greater growth and delivering strong,  sustainable returns for our shareholders.  Funding returns and growth through   smart capital management With the launch of our new growth plan Singtel28, we will  build on our proven capital recycling programme which  has unlocked value from assets such as our stakes in Indara  (formerly known as Australia Tower Network) and Airtel.  Asset monetisation gives us funding flexibility for growth  initiatives and we have already identified a further asset  pipeline of around S$6 billion.   Besides capital recycling, we also intend to seek private  capital partners as we scale our capital-intensive growth  businesses. We believe attracting the right investors will  bring a critical external lens to our businesses, valuable  strategic expertise and help illuminate their true value.  KKR’s commitment of up to S$1.1 billion for a 20% stake in  Nxera last September crystalised the value of our overall  regional data centre business at S$5.5 billion, and KKR has  the option to increase its stake to 25% by 2027. Through this  collaboration, Nxera can access capital to accelerate the  expansion of its regional data centre business across Asia  Pacific and also benefit from KKR’s strong track record in  digital infrastructure investments to scale up the platform  to become a meaningful growth engine for Singtel.  The value of our holdings in Airtel was similarly illuminated  through the recent sale of a 0.8% direct stake in Airtel  to GQG Partners which unlocked close to S$1.0 billion.  While Airtel remains a long-term strategic investment, we  have been working with our partner Bharti Enterprises to  gradually equalise our effective stake in Airtel over time.    Given the strategic transition of our business, we have  changed our dividend policy. Excess proceeds from our  recycling efforts will be used to support a new value  realisation dividend of 3 to 6 cents per share per annum,  allowing shareholders to benefit directly from our successful  capital management initiatives. This is in addition to a core  dividend which had its payout range increased to between  70% and 90% of underlying net profit last November.  Together, they will allow us to return capital to shareholders  in a sustained manner and progressively grow dividends,  reflective of what we want to achieve in Singtel28.  Note: (1)	 Compared to March 2021. 22  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Growth engines and digital banking   venture powering on  We have positioned the Group to capitalise on the   region’s rapidly growing digital economies through Nxera  and NCS, leveraging our expertise in digital services   and infrastructure. Nxera is scaling rapidly with its capital expenditure in the  near term fully funded by KKR’s investment and our green  loan. NCS has continued its expansion from the public to  the private sector and the region, and boosted margins by  stepping up and optimising their global delivery resources.  We have also made significant progress in the digital  banking space. KakaoBank joined forces with Singtel,   Grab and Emtek Group to invest in our Indonesian digital  bank Superbank, by acquiring a 10% stake. GXBank –   our digital bank venture with Grab and consortium  partners – made history as the inaugural digital bank  launched in Malaysia.  Regional associates capturing   opportunities in fixed mobile convergence Our regional associates, which started out as pure mobile  companies, are focusing on the opportunities in fixed  mobile convergence. This is an area we can add value  to given Singtel Singapore’s experience in the fixed  broadband business. Telkomsel, through the successful  integration of IndiHome, has solidified its leading  presence in Indonesia's connectivity market. Meanwhile,  AIS emerged as Thailand's leading fixed broadband  provider following regulatory approval of its merger with  3BB, extending connectivity benefits to more customers,  particularly in rural areas. These developments will  enhance the growth prospects of AIS and Telkomsel while  also being value accretive for us as a long-term investor.  Striving for a sustainable world  Sustainability is a resolute commitment for us and we have  brought forward our net-zero goal from 2050 to 2045 even  while we accelerate business growth. During the year, we  started to operationalise and embed an internal carbon fee  in purchases and business cases, and introduced our own  environmental weighted average cost of carbon – the first  in Singapore. With more granular emissions-related data  from vendors, we have been able to make more informed  decisions and further reduce our reported carbon emissions.  This internal carbon pricing (ICP) initiative expands on  earlier efforts to align our financing strategy to broader  sustainability goals through Olives, our sustainable financing  programme. Olives has grown to S$3.5 billion to date  and includes our first green loan for our data centres. We  have also been collaborating with our regional associates  to amplify the impact of our contributions as one Group,  sharing our experience on ICP and other best practices.  Delivering value realisation  The key goal of Singtel28 is to drive meaningful growth   in our business performance and deliver sustained  value realisation for shareholders. To achieve this objective,  we will continue to optimise the core businesses and scale  growth engines to deliver stronger EBIT growth and support  our mid-term goal of a low double-digit return on invested  capital. Shareholders can also expect better returns, as we  execute to our smart capital management policy.   Arthur Lang Group Chief Financial Officer, Singtel Beyond transforming the business, our proactive approach to   managing capital has helped us achieve better capital efficiency and   a more optimal capital structure. We unlocked S$8 billion of proceeds   from our capital management efforts. 23 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 26 ===== Singtel Singapore CEO Review Since I came on board last June, my leadership team and   I have been working closely to transform Singtel Singapore   to get us fighting fitter and more future-ready. For a   start, we have consolidated our consumer and enterprise  segments in Singapore into a single operating company   and established a roadmap of our own – Prime 26 – to  steer us towards long-term growth in a dynamic economy.  This plan involves creating new growth engines, getting  more efficient, streamlining our cost structures, enhancing  customer experiences and transforming the culture of our  organisation to achieve these ambitions. We are already  seeing early signs of savings flowing through to the   bottom-line, which will bear fruit in FY2025.  We continue to lead Singapore’s telecommunications  landscape, pioneering many global firsts in network  technologies that support the needs of consumers   and enterprises. Pivoting for growth Innovating with new technologies With digitalisation sweeping the world, enterprises are  seeking secure, reliable connectivity to support their  businesses, especially in mission-critical applications.  Backed by our strong engineering capabilities, we have been  innovating in areas such as 5G network slicing, application  programmable interfaces and AI, and developing new   digital solutions to meet these demands. Singtel CUB  is   a great example of how we are integrating our network   services to enable our customers to seamlessly orchestrate,  manage and service their enterprise networks from a   single, automated interface.  We are also continuing to expand our mobile capabilities  beyond our borders through connected cars and IoT  solutions which have grown our revenue by 41% year-on- year. This growth is enabled by our extensive roaming  networks and advanced network technologies such as  RedCap that significantly reduce the battery consumption  and production cost of IoT devices. This has opened a  universe of opportunities in the 5G IoT ecosystem from   smart watches to industrial sensors.   For consumers, we trialled a 5G Concert Pass service at the  recent Taylor Swift concert in Singapore. The pass provided  concertgoers with priority access to Singtel’s 5G network,  allowing them to enjoy stable, 1.5 times faster connectivity.  We also successfully trialled the world’s first app-based  network slicing technology which enables app owners  to activate a dedicated, customised slice of Singtel’s 5G  network to boost the performance of their apps and   enhance user experiences in situations involving high  network congestion. This innovation creates opportunities   for business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) partnerships  to bring differentiated customer experiences to everyone.  We continue to explore further business-to-consumer   and B2B2C applications of our 5G slicing capabilities for   our customers.  Creating value for customers Through our investments in generative AI and digitalisation  across our networks and operations we are helping our  customers, especially the small-medium enterprises to   scale their business and expand their digital and   analytics capabilities.  The increasing automation and digitalisation of our services  has also helped over 100,000 enterprise customers seamlessly  discover new products, make purchases, monitor business  performance and manage their network.  24  ===== PAGE 27 ===== For our consumers, we have been applying generative AI   to augment the capabilities of our digital assistants so   they can receive timely and personalised assistance.   This, coupled with several other measures, has resulted   in over 400,000 fewer calls, WhatsApp messages and  emails to our contact centres – significantly freeing up  capacity for our frontline staff to handle more complex  customer issues.  To add value beyond our shores, we have also revamped  our roaming offerings to include faster speeds, wider  coverage and more rewards via our one-stop cross-border  telco rewards programme which gives travellers access to  unique local deals. Developed in partnership with leading  regional telcos, these initiatives also help strengthen  customer loyalty. Boosting national resilience  New technological developments also bring growing threats  that affect both consumers and businesses.  Beyond our efforts to protect customers from the network   to device levels, we are helping consumers mitigate fraud   and scams with our recently launched application,  SingVerify – a seamless and secure authentication method  through which a customer’s identity is validated in real time  against phone numbers registered with service providers  and Singtel. Authentication is conducted in the background,  significantly reducing the opportunities for scammers to  take over the two-factor authentication or multi-factor  authentication process. We got M1 on board to better  combat this problem nationwide.  Similarly, to boost the cyber resilience of businesses in  Singapore, we launched the Cyber Elevate and Defence  Against Cyber Scams programmes and are providing  critical education and assistance, with the support of  SkillsFuture Singapore.  In keeping with Singtel’s ongoing nation-building and  future-proofing efforts, we are also developing Singapore’s  nationwide quantum safe network and related security  solutions to protect businesses from future quantum threats. Prioritising people and sustainability  Our people are the bedrock of our sustainable growth.   Our culture and change management approach is   focused on fostering a sense of belonging, empowering  our people to deliver meaningful, impactful work, and  supporting career growth through mobility and training.  Even as we reorganised our portfolio and moved offices,  we managed to improve our employee engagement scores  by 8% year-on-year to over 80%. This improvement puts us  at 15% above Singapore’s top quartile of highly engaged  companies and 8% above the global top quartile.  In line with our net-zero goals, we are making our operations  more environmentally friendly, upgrading our infrastructure  and leveraging technology to reduce our carbon footprint.  Such improvements include maximising the deployment   of solar photovoltaic panels across our facilities in Singapore  and electrifying our vehicle fleet by 2028 to enable an  annual reduction of scope 1 emissions by 450 tonnes. We  have also introduced e-SIM cards, which will reduce our  e-waste generation significantly.  We are ramping up our efforts in fostering digital inclusion  within our community, through partnerships with the South  West Community Development Council and Infocomm Media  Development Authority of Singapore. Together, we have been  running cyber awareness workshops for senior citizens so  they too can enjoy a digital lifestyle safely. We have also been  providing the migrant worker community with affordable  prepaid mobile plans as well as teaching them how to remit  funds securely via the Singtel hi!App. For our various initiatives, we have received accolades such   as the Cybersecurity Company of the Year from Frost &  Sullivan and the World Communication Awards for our strong   5G network. But despite these achievements, there’s no   room for complacency. Singtel Singapore will continue  pushing the boundaries of technology to deliver greater  value to our consumers and businesses.   Ng Tian Chong Chief Executive Officer, Singtel Singapore  Singtel Singapore’s roadmap, Prime 26, is focused on creating   new growth engines, getting more efficient, streamlining our cost structures,  enhancing customer experiences and transforming the culture of our  organisation to get us fighting fitter to thrive in a dynamic economy.  25 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 28 ===== The past financial year saw Optus strengthen our focus on  network resilience and rebuilding trust with our customers  as we looked to the future following the November 2023  network outage. This year’s performance demonstrates a resilient company  and culture, with stable EBITDA and EBIT when compared  with the year prior. Momentum however began to recover  in the second half, driving a 4.8% increase in EBITDA, whilst  EBIT grew by 20% to A$147 million. Over the year, Optus  added 116,000 customers to our mobile base, including solid  gains of 108,000 prepaid customers.    The outage was a challenging day for our customers and  the community. We are disappointed and deeply sorry that  we fell short of delivering the services expected of us. In  response, we have made important changes to systems  and processes, including the reconfiguration of some key  equipment and enhancing processes to allow restoration  activities to occur faster remotely. Delivering a reliable  experience for our customers is our focus and we have  committed additional investments into further strengthening  our network and technology resiliency.    We also continued our investments in cyber security,  delivering on our commitments to keep customer data safe.  We will continue to partner with global leaders in cyber  security and collaborate with the industry to ensure we  collectively stay vigilant. Rebuilding trust  We are excited to start executing on our new regional  network sharing agreement with TPG Telecom which  will mark a new era for telco services in Australia. The  agreement, which is subject to regulatory approval,  demonstrates our commitment to providing regional and  rural customers with real choice as well as a network that  delivers better capacity, speed and service quality. Under  this agreement, TPG Telecom will gain access to 2,444  Optus mobile network sites in regional Australia, increasing  its current national 4G coverage from around 400,000  square kilometres to around 1,000,000 square kilometres  and 98.4% of the population. The agreement will reduce  combined 5G network rollout costs in regional Australia,  which will enable the deployment of 5G infrastructure to   be completed two years earlier than previously planned. Meeting customer needs  Over the year, we have continued to simplify and improve  our customers’ experience in several key areas. We  introduced enhancements to the My Optus App, bringing  more meaningful experiences to our users, including an  improved shopping experience, 24/7 messaging support,  and easy payment options.  We have transformed our contact centres through integrated  automation, AI, data and analytics which have contributed  to a reduction in customer complaints, improved call centre  customer transfer rates and a 10% year-on-year uplift in first  call resolution rates.  At the same time, we are investing in ‘mobile-first’ solutions  for our enterprise and business customers. Optus has  partnered with Lendlease to deliver a mobile-first experience  Optus CEO Review Lasting customer  relationships are   our priority  26  ===== PAGE 29 ===== for its employees and those who live and work in its real  estate precincts. Optus’ network will enable Lendlease to  collaborate and monitor data in real time, enabling efficient  decision-making and streamlined project management.   Our small business customers have told us that building  digital capability is one of the key challenges that they  face. To help tackle this, we have created FutureFit, a series  of workshops to help enterprises go digital and learn to  identify and respond to business risks. Participants left the  sessions with a personalised strategy for their business,  including how to leverage technologies such as AI, social  media, digital marketing tools and website development.  We are always looking for ways to bring new technologies  to our customers and a significant step forward was   the SpaceX partnership announcement made in July 2023.  Optus’ work with SpaceX aims to bring the coverage  capabilities of satellites direct to compatible mobile  handsets without the need for customers to buy   additional equipment.  As a key contributor to the economy, it is imperative that  we do business responsibly. This year we launched a new  5G modem which is made with a minimum of 95% recycled  plastics and packaging that is 100% recyclable, with no  single-use plastics. Its packaging also includes guides on  how customers can recycle their old modem. Digital safety and inclusion Scam protections remain extremely important to us   and our customers. Working with key partners such as   the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange, we are  pioneering market-leading technology and initiatives   that better protect our customers from scammers.  Optus has implemented a series of anti-scam measures,  allowing us to block more than 380 million scam calls   and 130 million SMS scam messages since December  2020. ScamWise and Call Stop innovations were launched  this year to protect our customer community and we  remain committed to playing our part to address this  national priority alongside business, government and   the broader community. We continue to enhance the digital safety, well-being and  capability of young people and families with educational  workshops, guides and resources under our Digital  Thumbprint programme, which has educated more than  618,000 Australian students since it launched in 2013.  One of the most effective ways to address the digital   divide is Optus’ Donate Your Data programme. Since its  inception, the partnership has provided 37,500 students  and their family members with free SIM cards loaded with  calls, texts and data, which has supported children with  online learning and education. The unique programme has  expanded to include additional charities, and to date, over  44,500 people in total, including over 5,700 First Nations  participants, have received support with free calls, texts  and data. This equates to A$30 million of equivalent value  delivered across the life of the programme.   Best we can be for our customers There is no doubt that we have faced challenges over the  past 18 months, however we are focused on rebuilding  trusted relationships with our customers through the  dedication, energy and resilience of our people.  In the year ahead, we are focused on meeting – and  exceeding – our customer expectations: in the resiliency  of our network, simplifying their experiences and being a  more efficient company to deal with. Our customers’ needs  will always guide our decisions, and we are energised and  optimistic about what the future holds for them and the  communities we serve. Michael Venter Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Optus In the year ahead, we are focused on meeting –   and exceeding – our customer expectations:   in the resiliency of our network, simplifying their experiences   and being a more efficient company to deal with. 27 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 30 ===== THE NEXT GENERATION   OF DATA CENTRES Regional data centre business  valued at  S$5.5 billion  (1) Capacity to more than double from  across Singapore, Indonesia  and Thailand in 2023 by 2026 62MW 155MW The global growth in AI adoption is fuelling  the need for a new generation of data centres  optimised for the intensive AI workloads of  enterprises and cloud companies. With its extensive expertise and experience  designing, building and operating data centres,  complemented by the backing of leading   global investment firm KKR, Nxera is poised  to capture this demand with new sustainable,  hyper-connected AI-ready data centres as it  expands in Asia – one of the fastest growing  data centre regions in the world. Jan 2017   Singtel launches DC West,   a cloud-enabled, data centre  with next-generation   high-density computing and  high-speed connectivity. Dec 2022   Singtel partners Telkom   and Medco Power to build   a new 51MW hyperscale   data centre in Indonesia.

The 58MW data centre will  be one of Asia’s most efficient data  centres with a PUE of 1.23 at full load.  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Digital InfraCo CEO Review A new era in  transformation We live in an exciting era of rapid digitalisation, cloud and  AI adoption. Reliable, high quality digital infrastructure   has become the backbone of today’s societies and   economies, facilitating commerce, fostering innovation  and connecting people.  In line with the Group’s strategic reset to develop new growth  engines, Digital InfraCo was carved out as a new entity and  a catalyst for innovation and economic growth in the region  and beyond. Our diverse portfolio of businesses includes the  Group’s regional data centres, subsea cable and satellite  carriers as well as Paragon, our patented digital acceleration  platform for 5G multi-access edge compute and cloud  orchestration. We also have plans to offer GPU-as-a-Service  to empower and support enterprises with the adoption of AI. Boosting innovation with regional data   centre platform Singapore is a key data centre hub with excellent  connectivity, making it an ideal base for Nxera’s  expansion into the region to capture the rising demand  from the wave of digital transformation. To reflect our  strong leadership position in this space, we launched  our regional data centre brand, Nxera, derived from  ‘next era’; two words that herald a new generation of  sustainable, hyper-connected and AI-ready data centres  in this region. We aim to develop and grow the industry’s  most sustainable, next-generation digital assets with  extensive and diverse local and international network  connectivity for high intensity compute and AI workloads.  We are glad to have the support of leading global  investment firm KKR as we scale Nxera to become a  regional platform and leader. With KKR’s commitment   of up to S$1.1 billion for a 20% stake and expertise in data  centres and critical telecommunication infrastructure,  we are able to accelerate our expansion across the Asia   Pacific. Their investment is also a strong endorsement   of Nxera, placing the value of our data centre business   at S$5.5 billion.   Last August, we broke ground on Singapore’s highest  power density, hyper-connected green data centre,   DC Tuas. When operational in early 2026, DC Tuas will  offer 58MW of capacity. With a power usage efficiency of  less than 1.3 at full load, DC Tuas will feature a sustainable  design and build, as well as next-generation liquid cooling  systems. We are also developing partnerships to further  improve water usage effectiveness.   Besides Singapore, we are growing Nxera’s portfolio   with next-generation data centres in Thailand and  Indonesia which will more than double our total  operational capacity from the existing 62MW to over  155MW. We aim to reach more than 200MW in the next  three years and we will be entering new markets such as  Malaysia, and also exploring others in the region. We strongly believe that digitalisation does not have to   come at the expense of decarbonisation and we intend to  reach net-zero operational emissions by 2028. We will be  the first data centre operator to use sustainable energy  from the grid to reduce our overall carbon footprint. We will  also support our customers in their green transition journey,  working closely with our ecosystem of energy partners to  help them access a suite of carbon offset solutions.  30  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Having the right talent is also key to Nxera’s success. We are  partnering with various institutes of higher learning to form  a Regional Sustainable Data Centre Academy through which  we will develop a specially curated sustainable data centre  curriculum to grow the expertise in this field. Industry players  in Singapore and our regional joint ventures can also tap on  this Academy to develop their talent pipelines.  Advancing economies with cutting-edge  connectivity solutions Our comprehensive network of subsea fibre-optic cables  continues to provide customers with the best country-to- country connectivity in Asia Pacific. We signed an MOU  with Viettel to plan and develop a submarine cable system  directly connecting Vietnam and Singapore. This cable  system is scheduled to be operational by the second  quarter of 2027. Another noteworthy milestone is the  addition of multi-orbit satellite connectivity solutions to our  comprehensive carrier service portfolio – aimed at ensuring  high reliability, high speed performance and top-tier   quality experiences for our customers. These include the  launch of a new satellite that will go into orbit in mid- 2027, which will be ready for commercial service in early  2028 and the integration of Starlink services. We have  also won multiple contracts to host the gateways of some  geostationary equatorial orbit (GEO) and non-GEO  communications and earth observation satellite operators   to land their traffic in Singapore to connect to the internet  and their public/private cloud service providers.  Driving 5G adoption with industry-leading  Paragon  Paragon, our patented and comprehensive orchestration  platform, continues to gain traction and generate significant  interest among telco operators and enterprises.  Globally, enterprises have been actively embracing 5G  and edge computing. Paragon has been key in driving  this adoption – enabling faster monetisation of 5G  infrastructure and reducing complexities. In the past year,  we have extended Paragon’s footprint to five markets –  Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Spain and Indonesia. We  are also working with technology companies to expand  Paragon’s capabilities and network. One such partnership  is with Broadcom to combine the advanced capabilities  of Singtel’s 5G with VMware’s virtualisation, enabling  enterprises to support applications deployed on VMWare  with the Paragon platform.  As more telcos adopt this platform, this allows Paragon  to further scale – which in turn attracts more technology  partners to build more solutions, creating a virtuous  network effect of growth. This is extremely advantageous  to businesses operating in the smart city and telemedicine  domains, as well as automated factories where network  and application proximity is critical to real-time, high- performance operations.  Investing for growth  We will continue to build on our strong foundation by  innovating and developing new capabilities to achieve  the leadership and sustainability goals we have set for  ourselves across our data centre, carrier businesses as   well as Paragon. Committed to excellence, we strive  to redefine the landscape of digital infrastructure and  services. Our goal is to drive digital economies forward   in innovative and sustainable ways, establishing ourselves  as the undisputed leader in the field.

To this end, Singtel has a set of  well-defined policies and processes in place to enhance  corporate performance and accountability, as well as  protect the interests of stakeholders. The Board of Directors  is responsible for Singtel’s corporate governance standards  and policies, stressing their importance across the Group.  Singtel is listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading  Limited (SGX) and has complied in all material respects  with the principles and provisions in the Singapore Code of  Corporate Governance 2018 (2018 Code). This report sets  out Singtel’s governance organisation and our approach to  corporate governance practices with reference to the 2018  Code and the Practice Guidance to the 2018 Code (Practice  Guidance). Where there are deviations from the principles  and provisions, we have explained our rationale and set   out our practice to uphold the spirit of the 2018 Code.   We provide a summary of our compliance with the express  disclosure requirements in the 2018 Code on pages 76 to 77. At Singtel, our pursuit of exemplary corporate governance  extends beyond our core operations to the strategic oversight  of our three key subsidiaries, namely NCS Pte. Ltd. (NCS),  Nxera Investment Holdings Pte. Ltd. (Nxera) and Singtel   Optus Pty Limited (Optus). These key subsidiaries are  governed by dedicated subsidiary boards which are integral  components of our governance framework. The boards of   our key subsidiaries maintain distinct responsibilities to  oversee strategic initiatives, monitor performance and   ensure robust governance practices that align with the  Group's objectives. Board Matters Role of the Board The Board aims to create value for shareholders and   ensure the long-term success of the Group by focusing   on the development of the right strategy, business model,   risk appetite, management, succession plan and  compensation framework. It also seeks to align the interests  of the Board and Management with that of shareholders  and balance the interests of all stakeholders. In addition,  the Board sets the tone for the entire organisation where  ethics and values are concerned. The Board oversees the business affairs of the Group.   It assumes responsibility for the Group’s overall strategic  plans and performance objectives, financial plans and  annual budget, key operational initiatives, major funding  and investment proposals, financial performance reviews,  compliance and accountability systems, and corporate  governance practices. The Board also appoints the Group  CEO, approves policies and guidelines on remuneration  as well as the remuneration for the Board and the Group  Management Committee, and approves the appointment of  Directors. In line with best practices in corporate governance,  the Board also oversees the long-term succession planning   for the Group Management Committee.

The independent  Directors meet at least once annually. The Board holds up to six scheduled meetings each year  and may also hold ad hoc meetings as and when warranted  by circumstances. A total of eight Board meetings (including  two ad hoc Board meetings) were held in the financial  year ended 31 March 2024. Attendance at Board or Board  Committee meetings via telephone or video conference is  permitted by Singtel’s Constitution. Typically, where circumstances permit, one Board  meeting a year is held in Australia, where one of Singtel’s  key subsidiaries, Optus, is located. In addition, where  circumstances permit, the Board makes an overseas trip  annually to a country where the Group has a significant  investment or has an interest in investing, or where  Board members can explore new technology relevant  to the Group’s growth strategy. On such occasions,  the Board may meet with local business leaders and  government officials to help Board members gain greater  insight into those countries. The Board also meets with  Singtel’s partners and key customers in those countries  to develop stronger relationships with such partners and  customers. Board meetings may include presentations  by senior executives and external consultants/experts on  developments in areas relevant to the Group’s business.  This allows the Board to develop a good understanding of  the Group’s businesses and to promote active engagement  with the Group’s partners and key executives. Annual Strategy Management Workshop  Each year, the Singtel Board and Senior Management   hold a Strategy Management Workshop (SMW). In 2023,   the SMW was held in Sydney on 8 November 2023. The  SMW 2023 was structured around presentations and  facilitated discussions to foster collaborative thinking and  generate new ideas. The discussion agenda for the SMW  2023 focused on the achievements and learnings from the  Strategic Reset initiated in 2021, and the framework and  the key elements to move to the next phase of growth. The  discussions and the Board's guidance laid the foundations  for the next growth plan, which was then further developed  and sharpened, and then launched on 23 May 2024  as “Singtel28”, with particular focus on lifting business  performance and smart capital management to deliver  enhanced customer experiences and sustained value  realisation for shareholders.  All members of the Board and Senior Management team  attended the SMW 2023. Singtel has established financial authorisation and   approval limits for operating and capital expenditure,   the procurement of goods and services, and the acquisition  and disposal of investments. The Board approves  transactions exceeding certain threshold limits, while  delegating authority for transactions below those limits  to the Board Committees and the Group Management  Committee to optimise operational efficiency. Material items that require Board approval •	 The Group’s strategic plans •	 The Group’s annual operating plan and budget •	 Full-year and half-year financial results •	 Dividend policy and payout •	 Issue of shares •	 Board succession plans •	 Succession plans for Group Management Committee  positions, including appointment of, and compensation  for, Group Management Committee members •	 Underlying principles of long-term incentive schemes  for employees •	 The Group’s risk appetite and risk tolerance for  different categories of risk, as well as risk strategy   and the policies for management of material risks •	 Acquisitions and disposals of investments exceeding  certain material limits •	 Capital expenditure exceeding certain material limits •	 Interested Person Transactions exceeding certain  limits •	 Overall sustainability and climate-related strategies,  including materiality topics and reviews of the progress  and performance of the Group’s Environmental, Social  and Governance (ESG) commitments and strategy Board meetings The Board and Board Committees meet regularly to discuss  strategy, operational matters and governance issues. All  Board and Board Committee meetings are scheduled well  in advance of each year in consultation with the Directors.  At each scheduled Board meeting, the Board sets aside  time for discussion without the presence of Management  (except the executive Director) and also sets aside time   for the non-executive Directors to meet without any  executives present. This includes a session led by the   Lead Independent Director, without the Chairman present,  to appraise the Chairman’s performance and on any  Corporate Governance 38  ===== PAGE 41 ===== Decisions of Singtel’s Board are generally made by  consensus. Under Singtel’s Constitution, a quorum for  Board meetings is one-third of the Directors for the time  being (or, if their number is not a multiple of three, the  number nearest to but not less than one-third) or two  Directors, whichever is the higher number. Questions  arising at any Board meeting shall be determined by   a majority of votes. In cases of an equality of votes   (except where only two Directors are present and form   the quorum or when only two Directors are competent  to vote on the question in issue), the Chairman of the  meeting shall have a second or casting vote. For significant  issues, the Board convenes meetings to discuss and  deliberate such issues thoroughly, ensuring that critical  decisions benefit from comprehensive input and discussion.  In contrast, administrative or routine matters may be  efficiently resolved via circulating resolutions, provided they  are agreed upon by all Directors in Singapore forming a  quorum, including through approved electronic means.  A record of the Directors’ attendance at Board meetings  during the financial year ended 31 March 2024 is set  out below. Where a Director is unable to attend a Board  meeting, he is provided with the briefing materials and   may discuss issues relating to matters to be tabled at   the Board meeting with the Chairman or the Group CEO.

As far as possible,  such information is provided a week in advance of the  Board meeting. The Board also receives regular reports  pertaining to the operational and financial performance  of the Group, as well as information on developments  relevant to the Group. Such reports enable the Directors  to keep abreast of key issues and developments in the  industry, as well as challenges and opportunities for   the Group. The Board has separate and independent access to  Senior Management and the Company Secretary at all  times. Procedures are in place for Directors and Board  Committees, where necessary, to seek independent  professional advice, paid for by Singtel. Director development/training The Board values ongoing professional development  and recognises that it is important that all Directors  receive regular training to be able to serve effectively on,  and contribute to, the Board. The Board has therefore  adopted a policy on continuous professional development  for Directors. The Chairman and the Group CEO are  responsible for planning and implementing the Board’s  development programme, supported by the Company  Secretary and relevant Singtel Management. All Directors are encouraged to undergo continual  professional development during their term of appointment  to ensure that they are able to fulfill their obligations and  continually improve the performance of the Board. Professional development may relate to a particular  subject area, committee membership, or key developments  in Singtel’s environment, market or operations. Directors  are encouraged to consult the Chairman if they consider  that they personally, or the Board as a whole, would  benefit from specific education or training regarding  matters that fall within the responsibility of the Board   or relate to the business of Singtel. The Board has a structured orientation programme for  new Directors. As part of the programme, all new Directors  appointed to the Board are briefed by the Chairman,  as well as the chairmen of the Board Committees, on  issues relevant to the Board and Board Committees. They  are also briefed by Senior Management on the Group’s  business activities, strategic direction and policies, key  business risks, the regulatory environment in which the  Group operates and governance practices, as well as their  statutory and other duties and responsibilities as Directors.  In addition, Singtel arranges for new Directors to tour  various Singtel facilities, such as the Singtel FutureNow  Innovation Centre and the DC West data centre, to help  familiarise new Directors with the Group’s business. Directors who have no prior experience as a director of  an issuer listed on the SGX are provided with training  on the roles and responsibilities of a listed issuer in  accordance with the SGX listing rules. The training costs  are borne by Singtel. Singtel also arranges for additional  training conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors  and the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants as  requested by the Directors. Directors also receive briefings on ESG-related matters,  including specific discussions on overall climate strategy  and targets. Upon appointment to the Board, each Director receives  a Directors’ Manual, which sets out the Director’s duties  and responsibilities and the Board’s governance policies  and practices. The Directors’ Manual is maintained by  the Company Secretary. In line with best practices in  corporate governance, new Directors also sign a letter  of appointment from the Company stating clearly the  role of the Board and non-executive Directors, the time  commitment that would be expected of the Director   and other relevant matters. Board composition The Singtel Board has a strong independent element.  There are 13 Directors on the Board, comprising  11 independent non-executive Directors, one non- independent non-executive Director and one executive  Director. Non-executive Directors constitute at least  a majority of the Board to prevent undue influence of  Management and to ensure that appropriate checks and  balances are in place. The Board has appointed a Lead  Independent Director. A description of the role of the   Lead Independent Director is set out on page 50. The  profiles of the Directors are set out on pages 12 to 16   and pages 234 to 237. There are no alternate directors   on the Board. The size and composition of the Board are reviewed  from time to time by the Corporate Governance and  Nominations Committee (CGNC). The CGNC seeks to  ensure that the sizes of the Board and Board Committees  are conducive for effective discussion and decision  making, and that the Board has an appropriate number  Corporate Governance 40  ===== PAGE 43 ===== of independent Directors. The CGNC also aims to maintain  a diversity of expertise, skills and attributes among the  Directors. Any potential conflicts of interest are taken   into consideration. In order to ensure that Singtel continues to be able to meet  the challenges and demands of the markets in which Singtel  operates, the Board is focused on enhancing the diversity  of skills, expertise and perspectives on the Board in a  structured way, by proactively mapping out Singtel’s Board  composition needs over the short and medium term. Board membership and leadership succession The CGNC establishes and reviews the profile required of  Board members and makes recommendations to the   Board on the appointment, re-nomination and retirement  of Directors. In addition to establishing the required profiles for  Board members, the CGNC is also responsible for the  establishment and review of the Board’s succession  plans. These plans are critical to ensuring the continuity  and vitality of our governance framework. The CGNC’s  efforts are complemented by the Executive Resource and  Compensation Committee (ERCC), which periodically  review the succession planning for the Group Management  Committee including the Group CEO, with a formal review  carried out prior to submission of the succession plan to   the Board on an annual basis. If external candidates are to   be considered in the event of the replacement of the   Group CEO, the Chairman of the Board will draw upon  resources from the ERCC and the CGNC and lead a  special process to identify high-calibre individuals  capable of delivering to the Company’s present and future  requirements. This structured approach ensures that both  Board-level and executive management successions are  handled with foresight and strategic alignment, supporting  seamless transitions and sustained leadership effectiveness  across Singtel.  When an existing Director chooses to retire, or is required to  retire from office by rotation, or the need for a new Director  arises, the CGNC reviews the range of expertise, skills and  attributes of the Board and the composition of the Board.  The CGNC then identifies Singtel’s needs and prepares  a shortlist of candidates with the appropriate profile for  nomination or re-nomination. The CGNC takes factors such as attendance, preparedness,  participation and candour into consideration when  evaluating the past performance (including his or her  performance as an independent Director), commitment,  and contributions of a Director during the Board  recommendation process. However, the re-nomination or  replacement of a Director does not necessarily reflect the  Director’s performance or contributions to the Board. The  CGNC may have to consider the need to position and shape  the Board in line with the evolving needs of Singtel and   the business. When deciding on the appointment of new Directors to   the Board, the CGNC and the Board consider a variety  of factors, including the core competencies, skills and  experience that are required on the Board and Board  Committees, as well as diversity, independence, conflicts   of interest and time commitments. To find suitable  candidates, the CGNC may utilise multiple channels,  including external search consultants, to ensure a wide   and diverse talent pool. The selection process is rigorous, with a clear emphasis  on diversity and inclusion. As part of our commitment to  gender diversity, the CGNC ensures that female candidates  are included for consideration whenever a new Director  is sought. The evaluation of potential Directors involves  thorough interviews and reference checks, conducted   prior to a candidate’s endorsement by the CGNC.  Directors must ensure that they are able to give sufficient  time and attention to the affairs of Singtel and, as part of its  review process, the CGNC decides whether or not a Director  is able to do so and whether he has adequately carried  out his duties as a Director of Singtel. The Board has also  adopted an internal guideline that seeks to address the  competing time commitments that may be faced when a  Director holds multiple board appointments. The guideline  provides that, as a general rule, each Director should hold  no more than five directorships in public listed companies.  However, the Board recognises that the individual  circumstances and capacity of each Director differ and   there may be circumstances where a different limit on   board appointments is appropriate. The guideline also  provides that (a) in support of their candidature for  directorship or re-election, Directors are to provide the  CGNC with details of other commitments and an indication  of the time involved; and (b) non-executive Directors   should consult the Chairman or chairman of the CGNC  before accepting any new appointments as Directors. Based on reviews of participation and contributions during  Board and Board Committee meetings for FY2024, the   CGNC and the Board were satisfied that all Directors,  including those with other directorships and/or other  principal commitments, were able to perform, and had  diligently discharged, their duties on the Board.  41 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 44 ===== Board tenure In order to ensure Board renewal, the Board has in place  guidelines on the tenure of the Chairman and Directors. The  guidelines provide that Directors are appointed for an initial  term of three years and this may be extended to a second  three-year term. As a general rule, a Director shall step  down from the Board no later than at the Annual General  Meeting (AGM) to be held in his sixth year of service. Where  a Director is not appointed at an AGM, the Director’s term  will be deemed to have commenced on the date of the AGM  immediately following the date on which the Director was  appointed. The CGNC may, in appropriate circumstances,  recommend to the Board that a Director’s term be extended  beyond the second three-year term. For the Chairman, the  same principles apply except that the term is determined  from the point he became the Chairman.  The Company’s Constitution provides that a Director must  retire from office at the third AGM after the Director was  elected or last re-elected. A retiring Director is eligible for re-election by Singtel  shareholders at the AGM. In addition, a Director appointed  by the Board to fill a casual vacancy or appointed as an  additional Director may only hold office until the next  AGM, at which time he will be eligible for re-election by  shareholders. If at any AGM, fewer than three Directors  would retire pursuant to the requirements set out above,  the additional Directors to retire at that AGM shall be those  who have been longest in office since their last re-election  or appointment. The Group CEO, as a Director, is subject to  the same retirement by rotation, resignation and removal  provisions as the other Directors, and such provisions will  not be subject to any contractual terms that may have been  entered into with the Company. Shareholders are provided  with relevant information in the Annual Report on the  candidates for election or re-election. For the forthcoming 32nd AGM, the Board, following the  recommendation of the CGNC, has proposed the re-election  of Directors, namely Mr Gautam Banerjee, Mr Lim Swee Say,  Mr Rajeev Suri, Mr Wee Siew Kim and Mr Yuen Kuan Moon,  upon their retirement in accordance with Article 100 of the  Company’s Constitution. Being eligible, the said Directors  have offered themselves for re-election by shareholders. The CGNC has considered the experience and contributions  of Mr Gautam Banerjee as a long-serving member of the  Board. The CGNC is of the opinion that it is in the Group’s  interests for Mr Banerjee to continue serving on the Board  beyond his sixth year of service, to provide continuity and  insights into the business. Mr Banerjee has served for many  years on the Audit Committee (AC), the CGNC and the Risk  and Sustainability Committee (RSC), allowing Singtel to tap  into his distinguished experience within the finance industry.   As chairman of the AC and CGNC, he plays a pivotal role in  helping Singtel navigate key issues relating to the Group’s  risk exposures and leadership succession. He is also the   Lead Independent Director. The Board has been notified that Mrs Christina Ong   and Ms Teo Swee Lian wish to step down from the Board   at the forthcoming 32nd AGM. The Board extends its  deepest thanks for their invaluable contributions and  dedicated service. Board diversity Singtel is committed to building a diverse, inclusive and  collaborative culture. Singtel recognises and embraces the  benefits of diversity on the Board, and views diversity at the  Board level as essential to supporting the attainment of its  strategic objectives and its sustainable development.   A diverse Board will include and make good use of  differences between the Directors in terms of skills,  experience, background, gender, age, ethnicity and  Corporate Governance 42  ===== PAGE 45 ===== other relevant factors. Such diversity allows for different  viewpoints to be represented, encourage richer discussions  amongst the Board and Management and help drive   better outcomes for the Group. Since 2016, the Board has adopted a Board Diversity  Policy to ensure an appropriate balance of perspectives,  skills and experience on the Board. The Board Diversity  Policy provides that, in reviewing Board composition and  succession planning, the CGNC will consider the benefits  of all aspects of diversity, including diversity of skills,  experience, background, gender, age, ethnicity and other  relevant factors. These differences will be considered in  determining the optimum composition of the Board and,  when possible, should be balanced appropriately. All   Board appointments are made based on merit, in the  context of the skills, experience, independence and  knowledge which the Board as a whole requires to be  effective. Diversity is a key criterion in the instructions to  external search consultants. The Board’s diversity targets are as follows: •	 Gender diversity: At least 30% of Directors should be  female; •	 Geographic diversity: The Board will include international  Directors (based outside of Singapore) on the Board  to provide expertise and connections in geographical  regions where the Group has operations; and •	 Skills diversity: In view of the size and complexity of the  Group and the business and regulatory environment in  which it operates, Singtel aims to have expertise across  different domain knowledge and functional disciplines  represented on the Board, including expertise in  technology, legal/regulatory, sustainability, audit, risk,  people, investments and public policy. The Board’s current composition reflects its commitment   to diversity in all the abovementioned areas.  In relation to gender diversity, 46% of the Singtel Board,  or six out of the 13 Board members, are female. The  Board is of the view that gender is an important aspect  of diversity and will strive to ensure that (a) any brief to  external search consultants to identify candidates for  appointment to the Board will include a requirement to  present female candidates; (b) female candidates are  included for consideration by the CGNC whenever it  seeks to identify a new Director for appointment to   the Board; (c) the Board appoints at least one female  Director to the CGNC; and (d) there is significant and  appropriate female representation on the Board,  recognising that the Board’s needs will change over   time taking into account the skills and experience of   the Board. In relation to geographical diversity, three of Singtel’s   13 Directors, namely, Mr John Arthur, Mrs Gail Kelly  and Mr Rajeev Suri, are based in and have extensive  experience in jurisdictions outside Singapore including  Australia, the United States of America, the United  Kingdom and Europe. The Singapore-based Directors  also have experience with countries outside Singapore,  including countries in the Asia Pacific. In relation to skills diversity, the current Board comprises  members who are business leaders and professionals with  diverse expertise, experience and backgrounds including  telecommunications, engineering, technology, investment,  banking, finance, accounting/audit, legal, regulatory/ government, public policy and general management. 43 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 46 ===== Corporate Governance Expertise and Experience Matrix Strategic   Planning Organisation  Development Human  Resources  Finance Mergers &  Acquisitions Consumer  Marketing Technology/ Digital Legal Regulatory Government ESG/  Sustainability Non-Profit Expertise and Experience by Geography Australia Indonesia Singapore Thailand Philippines India China Asia Pacific USA Independence Independent,   non-executive  Directors 84% Non-independent,   non-executive  Director 8% Executive Director/ Group CEO 8% Length of Service 0-3 years 39% >3-5 years 31% >5-7 years 15% >9 years 15% Gender Diversity Male Directors 54% Female Directors 46% Age of Directors 51-55 8% 56-60 31% 61-65 15% 66-70 31% 71-75 15% 77% 62% 69% 46% 54% 23% 54% 31% 54% 54% 31% 15% 46% 31% 85% 31% 15% 31% 31% 15% 23% 44  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Directors' independence The Board, taking into account the views of the CGNC,  assesses the independence of each Director annually, and  as and when circumstances require, in accordance with the  2018 Code. A Director is considered independent if he has  no relationship with the Company, its related corporations,  substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere  or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of  the Director’s independent business judgement in the best  interests of the Company. The Board considers the existence of relationships or  circumstances, including those identified by the listing rules  of the SGX and the Practice Guidance, that are relevant in   its determination as to whether a Director is independent.  Such relationships or circumstances include the employment  of a Director by the Company or any of its related  corporations during the financial year in question or in   any of the previous three financial years; a Director being   on the Board for an aggregate period of more than nine  years; the acceptance by a Director of any significant  compensation from the Company or any of its subsidiaries  for the provision of services during the financial year  in question or the previous financial year, other than  compensation for board service; and a Director being  related to any organisation to which the Company or any  of its subsidiaries made, or from which the Company or   any of its subsidiaries received, significant payments or  material services during the financial year in question or   the previous financial year. The CGNC and the Board have assessed the independence  of each of the Directors in FY2024. A summary of the  outcome of that assessment is set out below. Based on the declarations of independence provided by   the Directors and taking into consideration the guidance   in the 2018 Code, the listing rules and (where relevant)   the Practice Guidance, the Board has determined that   Mr Lee Theng Kiat, Chairman of the Board and Mr Yuen  Kuan Moon, Singtel’s Group CEO are the only non- independent Directors. All other members of the Board are  considered to be independent Directors. In line with the  Board’s Code of Conduct and Ethics, each of the members  of the CGNC and the Board abstained in respect of the  confirmation of his/her independence status. Mr Lee Theng Kiat is deemed non-independent given his  previous role as Executive Director of Temasek Holdings  (Private) Limited (Temasek) between April 2019 and  September 2021 and his current roles as a non-executive  Director of Temasek and the Chairman of Temasek  International Pte. Ltd. He is not a nominee of Temasek on   the Singtel Board and does not act for Temasek in respect   of his Board role at Singtel.  Mr John Arthur Mr John Arthur is a non-executive Director on the boards of  Singtel’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, NCS Pte Ltd (NCS)   and Singtel Optus Pty Limited (Optus) and is Chairman of  Optus’ Audit Committee. He receives directors’ fees from  NCS and Optus.  The Board has considered the conduct of Mr Arthur in the  discharge of his duties and responsibilities as a Director   and is of the view that the abovementioned relationships did  not impair his ability to act with independent judgement in  the discharge of his duties and responsibilities as a Director.  Apart from the relationships stated above, Mr Arthur does  not have any other relationships and is not faced with any  of the circumstances identified in the 2018 Code, the SGX  Listing Manual and the Practice Guidance that may affect  his independent judgement. The Board is of the view that   Mr Arthur has demonstrated independence in the discharge  of his duties and responsibilities as a Director and is  therefore an independent Director. Mr Arthur will recuse  himself from participating in any deliberations of the Board  on any transactions that could potentially give rise to a  conflict of interest.

Board performance and evaluation The Board undertakes a rigorous and formal evaluation of  its performance and that of its committees and individual  Directors each year. The evaluations are overseen by the  CGNC and they enable the Board to identify key strengths  and areas for enhancement, as well as provide insights  on the Board’s culture. For 2024, an independent external  consultant, Willis Towers Watson (WTW), was appointed  to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation. The CGNC  considered WTW, who had undertaken the 2023 evaluation,  to be best placed to reflect on the progress made by   the Board since the last evaluation. The evaluation   involved detailed interviews by WTW to seek qualitative  feedback and insights from each Board member and   Senior Management. The 2024 evaluation was conducted based on a framework  that focused on the Board’s role in regulatory conformance,  organisational performance and sustainability and future-  proofing. The key themes explored included: •	 the Board’s role in Singtel’s transformation strategy; •	 the Group’s governance structure;  •	 the Board’s capabilities for the future of Singtel; •	 the Board’s culture and contributions; •	 the Board Committees and meeting structure; and •	 the relationship between the Board and management. The findings were evaluated by the consultant and  reported, together with the consultant’s recommendations,  to the CGNC and then the Board. The overall feedback  from the Board and Management was positive, with candid  views that gave valuable insights into the Board’s strengths  as well as ideas to consider for enhancing the Board’s  effectiveness. Key findings included the following: •	 the general view is that the Board is a high functioning  board, with high-calibre directors and a well-balanced  diversity of skills and experience;  •	 the Board is active in its oversight of strategy with focus on  supporting management in execution and delivery   of results; and  •	 the Board culture is seen by the Board and Management  as being harmonious and respectful with a strong  collegiate culture and healthy diversity of views and  absence of partisanship. The Directors have a high   degree of commitment in the interest of the Company. As a result of the evaluation and the discussions that  followed, the Board identified areas of particular focus  and related actions: Focus area Summary of actions Group governance •	 Continue review of the Group  operating model and focus on  streamlining interaction between  Group and subsidiary boards and  committees •	 With the Board’s increasing focus  on sustainability issues, the aim is to  establish a separate Sustainability  Committee (currently part of the  Risk and Sustainability Committee)  that will focus on sustainability  matters, including coordinating the  work of the other Board Committees  on sustainability-related matters Relationship with  senior management •	 Consider a mentor system between  Board members and members of  the Senior Management team As part of the external Board evaluation, WTW provided  feedback in its report on the performance of the Chairman.    The performance of the GCEO is assessed by the ERCC   and the non-executive Board as part of the yearly  performance evaluation of all employees. In addition to the annual Board evaluation process, the  contributions and performance of each Director and the  Board Committees are assessed by the CGNC in the   context of its periodic reviews of the composition of the  Board and Board Committees. The Board is also able to  assess the performance of the Board Committees through  their regular reports to the Board on their activities.  In the process, the CGNC and Board are able to identify   areas for improving the effectiveness of the Board and  Board Committees. 49 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 52 ===== The Chairman works with the Board, the relevant Board  Committees and Management to establish the boundaries  of risk undertaken by the Group and ensure that governance  systems and processes are in place and regularly evaluated.

A copy of the terms of reference  for each Board Committee is available on the corporate  governance page of Singtel’s website at www.singtel.com/ about-us/company/corporate-governance. The selection of Board Committee members requires  careful management to ensure that each Board Committee  comprises Directors with appropriate qualifications  and skills, and that there is an equitable distribution of  responsibilities among Board members. The need to  maximise the effectiveness of the Board, and encourage  active participation and contribution from Board members,  is also taken into consideration.

Audit Committee  Membership Gautam Banerjee, committee chairman and independent  non-executive Director Gail Kelly, independent non-executive Director  Tan Tze Gay, independent non-executive Director Key Objective •	 Assist the Board objectively in discharging its statutory  and other responsibilities relating to internal controls and  management of financial, operational, compliance and  information technology risks The terms of reference of the AC provide that the AC shall  comprise at least three Directors, all of whom are non- executive Directors and the majority, including the Chairman,  are independent Directors. At least two members of the AC,  including the AC Chairman, must have recent and relevant  accounting or related financial management expertise or  experience. The Chairman of the AC is not the Chairman of  the Singtel Board. The AC members are not former partners or  directors of KPMG LLP, the external auditor of the Group, and  hold no financial interest in the firm. The AC has explicit authority to investigate any matter within  its terms of reference, and has full cooperation and access to  Management. It has direct access to the internal and external  auditors, and full discretion to invite any Director or executive  officer to attend its meetings, and reasonable resources to  enable it to discharge its functions. It also has the authority  to review its terms of reference and its own effectiveness  annually and recommend necessary changes to the Board. The main responsibilities of the AC are to assist the  Board objectively in discharging its statutory and other  responsibilities relating to internal controls, including  information technology controls, financial and accounting  matters, compliance, business and financial risk management.  In the next financial year, with the IFRS Sustainability  Disclosure Standards issued by the International Sustainability  Standards Board (ISSB) taking effect, the AC’s role  and responsibilities are expanded to oversee relevant  sustainability disclosures and the related internal controls. The AC met four times during the financial year. At these  meetings, the Group CEO, Group CFO, Group Chief  Corporate Officer, Group Financial Controller, Managing  Director (Group Finance), Vice President (Group Financial  Reporting), Group Chief Internal Auditor and the respective  CEOs of the businesses were also in attendance. The AC reports to the Board on the results of the audits  conducted by the internal and external auditors, the  adequacy of information disclosure, and the effectiveness   of the risk management and internal control. It reviews  the half-yearly and annual financial statements with  Management and the external auditors, as well as the   internal and external auditors’ evaluation of the Group’s  internal controls. The AC also reviews and approves the  annual audit plans for the internal and external auditors.  During the financial year, the AC met with the internal   and external auditors without the presence of   Management quarterly.  With the Singtel Group’s move to adopt a decentralised  operating company-driven structure, Optus has established  the Optus AC to provide oversight on Optus’ financial  reporting, accounting matters, internal controls and activities  by the external and internal auditors. The Optus AC, chaired  by Mr John Arthur (independent non-executive Director of  Singtel), held its inaugural meeting in May 2024 and will   meet quarterly.  51 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 54 ===== External Audit The AC is responsible for evaluating the cost effectiveness   of external audits, the independence and objectivity of   the external auditors, and the nature and extent of the   non-audit services provided by the external auditors to  ensure that the independence of the external auditors is   not compromised. It also makes recommendations to the  Board on the appointment or re-appointment, remuneration  and terms of engagement of the external auditors.  The external auditors provided regular updates and  periodic briefings to the AC on changes or amendments   to accounting standards to enable the AC members to keep  abreast of such changes and their potential impact on the  financial statements. Directors are also invited to attend  relevant seminars on changes to accounting standards   and related issues, conducted by leading accounting firms. Internal Audit The AC approves the Singtel Internal Audit Charter and  reviews the internal audit function for independence  and effectiveness, resource adequacy, including staff  qualifications and experience, and its standing within  Singtel. The AC also reviews the performance of Internal  Audit (IA), including approving decisions relating to  appointment or removal of the Group Chief Internal Auditor  and approving the performance and compensation of  the Group Chief Internal Auditor. Based on this, the AC is  satisfied that the internal audit function is independent,  effective and adequately resourced. During the financial year, the AC reviewed Management’s  and Singtel IA’s assessment of fraud risk and held discussions  with the external auditors to obtain reasonable assurance  that adequate measures were in place to mitigate fraud risk  exposure in the Group. Annually, the AC reviews the adequacy  of the whistleblower arrangements established by the Group,  through which staff and external parties can confidentially  raise concerns about possible improprieties in financial  reporting or other matters. All whistleblower complaints  were reviewed half-yearly by the AC to ensure independent,  thorough investigations and adequate follow-up. The AC also reviewed the results of audits conducted by  IA based on the approved audit plan, significant litigation  and fraud investigations, register of interested person  transactions and non-audit services rendered by the  external auditors during the financial year. Financial reporting and disclosure matters Following the amendments to Rule 705 of the SGX Listing  Manual on 7 February 2020, the Group adopted half-yearly  announcements of its financial results with effect from   1 April 2020. This is complemented with business updates  for the first quarter and third quarter. The AC reviewed  the half-year and full-year financial statements, and the  business updates of the Group before the announcement  of the Group’s results.

Accountability and Audit  Risk management and internal control The Board has overall responsibility for the governance   of risk and exercises oversight of the material risks in   the Group’s business. During the financial year ended   31 March 2024, the RSC assisted the Board in the oversight  of the Group’s risk profile and policies, adequacy and  effectiveness of the Group’s risk management system  including the framework and process for the identification  and management of significant risks, and reports to the  Board on material matters, findings and recommendations  pertaining to risk management and sustainability. The AC  provides oversight of the financial reporting risks and the  adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal control  and compliance systems. The Board has approved a Group Risk Management  Framework for the identification of key risks within the  business. This Framework is aligned with the ISO 31000:2018  Risk Management framework and the Committee of  Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission  (COSO) Internal Controls Integrated Framework. As part of  our efforts to continuously improve risk management, we  have enhanced our controls assurance environment and  Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) compliance programme.  Corporate Governance 56  ===== PAGE 59 ===== Major incidents and violations, if any, are reported to the  Board to facilitate the Board’s oversight of the effectiveness  of crisis management and the adequacy of mitigating  measures taken by Management to address the  underlying risks. The identification and day-to-day management of risks  rest with Management. Management is responsible for the  effective implementation of risk management strategies,  policies and processes to facilitate the achievement  of business plans and goals within the risk tolerance  established by the Board. Key business risks are proactively  identified, addressed and reviewed on an ongoing basis. The Risk Management Committee, including relevant  members from the Senior Management team, is responsible  for setting the direction of corporate risk management and  monitoring the implementation of risk management policies  and procedures including the adequacy of the Group’s  insurance programme. The Risk Management Committee  reports to the RSC. The Board has established a Risk Appetite Statement and  Risk Tolerance Framework to provide guidance to the  Management on key risk parameters. In this financial year,  the Risk Appetite Statement has been expanded to include  tax risks. The significant risks in the Group’s business,  including mitigating measures, were also reviewed by the  RSC on a regular basis and reported to the Board. Risk  registers are maintained by the business and operational  units which identify the key risks facing the Group’s business  and the internal controls in place to manage those risks. The  RSC had reviewed the Group’s risk management framework  during the reporting period and was satisfied that it  continued to be sound. Internal and external auditors conduct audits that involve  testing the effectiveness of the material internal control  systems within the Group, relating to financial, operational,  compliance and information technology risks. Any   material non-compliance or lapses in internal controls  are reported to the AC, including the remedial measures  recommended to address the risks identified. The AC   also reviews the adequacy and timeliness of the actions  taken by Management in response to the recommendations  made by the internal and external auditors. Control   self-assessments in key areas of the Group’s operations are  conducted by Management on a periodic basis to evaluate  the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management  and internal control systems, including half-yearly and  annual certifications by Management to the AC and the  Board respectively on the integrity of financial reporting and  the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management,  internal control and compliance systems. The Group has put in place a Board Escalation Process  where major incidents and violations including major/  material operational loss events and potential breaches of  laws and regulations by the Company and/or its key officers,  are required to be reported by Management and/or IA to   the Board immediately to facilitate the Board’s oversight  of crisis management and adequacy and effectiveness  of follow-up actions taken by Management. Through this  process, the Board has been kept informed promptly of  any incidents with potential material financial, operational,  compliance and information technology risk impact. On 8 November 2023, the Optus network in Australia  experienced a national outage affecting consumer fixed  and mobile services and some enterprise and business  services. The Optus team resolved the outage for majority of  services on the same day. Optus management is cooperating  with ongoing regulatory inquiries and investigations related  to the outage and remains committed to continuously  improving the resiliency of its network. Cyber risk continues to be a key risk that is managed within  the Group. Optus management continues to cooperate with  regulatory investigations and defend proceedings relating  to the September 2022 cyber attack. Optus management  also continues to further enhance its cyber capabilities in  response to the changing threat environment. The Board has received assurance from the Group CEO and  Group CFO that, as at 31 March 2024, the Group’s financial  records have been properly maintained, the financial  statements give a true and fair view of the Group’s financial  position, operations and performance, and that they are  prepared in accordance with accounting standards. The Board has also received assurance from the Group CEO,  Group CFO and the other Group Management Committee  members that the Group’s internal controls and risk  management systems were adequate and effective as at   31 March 2024 to address financial, operational, compliance  and information technology risks, which the Group considers  relevant and material to its operations. Based on the internal controls established and maintained  by the Group, work performed by internal and external  auditors, reviews performed by Management and the  various Board Committees as well as assurances from  members of the Group Management Committee, the  Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion  that the Group’s internal controls and risk management  systems were adequate and effective as at 31 March 2024 to  address financial, operational, compliance and information  technology risks, which the Group considers relevant and  material to its operations.  	 57 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 60 ===== The systems of risk management and internal control  established by Management provide reasonable, but  not absolute, assurance that Singtel will not be adversely  affected by any event that can be reasonably foreseen as it  strives to achieve its business objectives. However, the Board  also notes that no system of risk management and internal  control can provide absolute assurance in this regard, or  absolute assurance against poor judgement in decision- making, human error, losses, fraud or other irregularities. Further details of the Group’s Risk Management Philosophy  and Approach can be found on pages 80 to 91. External auditor The Board is responsible for the initial appointment of the  external auditor who is then approved by the shareholders  at Singtel’s AGM. The external auditor holds office until  it is removed or resigns. The AC assesses the external  auditor based on factors such as the effectiveness of the  audit process, resources, independence and objectivity,  and recommends its appointment to the Board. In this  assessment, the AC considers the Audit Quality Indicators  Disclosure Framework issued by the Accounting and  Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and is guided by  Practice Guidance 10 of the 2018 Code. Pursuant to the requirements of the SGX, an audit partner  may only be in charge of a maximum of five consecutive  annual audits and may then return after two years. KPMG  has met this requirement. Singtel has complied with Rules  712, 715 and 716 of the SGX Listing Manual in relation to the  appointment of its external auditor. The AC monitors the performance, objectivity and  independence of the external auditor based on the policies  and approval processes in place regarding the types of  non-audit services that the external auditor can provide to  the Group. The AC has considered the revisions to the Ethics  Pronouncement 100 of the Code of Professional Conduct  and Ethics in the review of the non-audit services provided  by the external auditor during the financial year and the  associated fees. The AC is satisfied that the independence  and objectivity of the external auditor has not been impaired  by the provision of those services. The external auditor has  also provided confirmation of its independence to the AC.

As part of the programme,  internal quality assurance reviews are conducted quarterly  and external quality assurance reviews are performed  at least once every five years by qualified professionals  from an external organisation. The last external quality  assurance review was successfully completed in 2022 and  Singtel IA received the highest rating of “generally conforms”,  continuing to meet or exceed the IIA Standards and the Code  of Ethics in all key aspects. Singtel IA adopts a risk-based approach to formulating its  annual audit plan, aligning its activities with the Group’s  key strategies and risks. This plan is reviewed and approved  by the AC. Singtel IA’s reviews aim to assist the Board in  promoting sound risk management, robust internal controls  and good corporate governance. It assesses the design and  operating effectiveness of controls governing key business  processes and risks identified in the Group’s overall risk  framework. Singtel IA’s reviews focus on compliance with  Singtel’s policies, procedures and regulatory responsibilities  within the scope of financial and operational, revenue  assurance and information systems reviews. All significant findings and management’s mitigation  plans from the completed audits are reported to Senior  Management and the AC. Singtel IA monitors the  implementation status of the audit recommendations, and  overdue corrective actions are also reported to the Senior  Management and the AC. In the past year, Singtel IA has expanded its continuous  auditing capability to include a broader range of use  cases, allowing for more comprehensive risk-based audit  coverage and more timely reporting of irregularities and  follow-up actions. The Data Analytics and Robotics function  within Singtel IA has continued to prioritise upskilling  Corporate Governance 58  ===== PAGE 61 ===== the team through targeted training programmes, which  has been instrumental in enhancing risk assessment and  audit execution. In addition, pilot test for insider threat  detection has been initiated, leveraging a combination  of machine learning and rule-based methodologies to  strengthen data analytics initiatives. Embracing Agile  methodologies has been a key driver in elevating Singtel IA’s  performance. Selected teams within Singtel IA have piloted  or implemented Agile ways of working, and Agile playbooks  have been developed to guide broader Agile implementation  drive planned in FY2025, further transforming its work  and stakeholder interactions to increase the value and  contribution of Singtel IA to the Group.

By understanding our stakeholders’  needs, interests and concerns, we ensure the relevance  of our sustainability strategy and programmes to deliver  the intended outcome and impact. We undertake a formal  stakeholder engagement exercise, which is facilitated by a  third party at least once every three to five years. Singtel’s  executives are involved in ongoing engagements with these  stakeholders through various channels. We also engage our stakeholders to validate the impacts  that Singtel’s business operations create on people, the  environment and economy, including human rights. These  impacts are prioritised through the consideration of their  severity, including the potential for remediation of negative  impacts and occurrence of potential impacts. The prioritised  impacts form the final list of material topics upon which  targets, metrics, programmes and progress are reviewed  and approved by the Board, before they are published  annually in Singtel’s Sustainability Report.

The policy also provides that any of the  above persons who is privy to any material unpublished  price-sensitive information relating to the Group should not  trade in Singtel securities until the information is appropriately  disseminated to the market, regardless of whether it is during  the abovementioned “closed” periods for trading in Singtel  securities. Singtel will also not undertake any buy-back or  acquisition of its securities during the ''closed'' periods and at  Corporate Governance 60  ===== PAGE 63 ===== any time after a price or trade sensitive development has  occurred or has been the subject of a decision until the price  or trade sensitive information has been publicly announced.  The Company Secretary sends regular reminders of the  requirements under the policy and the relevant laws and  regulations to the Directors and Management. A Director is required to notify Singtel of his interest in Singtel  securities within two business days after (a) the date on which  he becomes a Director; or (b) the date on which he acquires  an interest in Singtel securities. A Director is also required to  notify Singtel of any change in his interests in Singtel securities  within two business days after he becomes aware of such  change. Singtel will file such disclosure with SGX within one  business day of receiving notification from the Director. The Securities Transactions Policy also discourages trading  on short-term considerations and reminds Directors and  officers of their obligations under insider trading laws.  Directors and officers of the Group wishing to deal in  Singtel securities during a closed period must secure prior  written approval of the Chairman (in the case of Directors  of Singtel), the Lead Independent Director (in the case of  the Chairman) or the Group CEO (in the case of directors of  Singtel subsidiaries and Key Officers). Requests for written  approval must contain a full explanation of the exceptional  circumstances and proposed dealing. If approval is granted,  trading must be undertaken in accordance with the limits  set out in the written approval. Directors are to inform the  Company Secretary before trading in Singtel securities. The  Board is kept informed when a Director trades in Singtel  securities. A summary of Singtel’s Securities Transactions  Policy is available in the Corporate Governance section of  the Singtel corporate website. Pursuant to the SGX Listing Manual, Singtel has put in place  a policy relating to the maintenance of a list(s) of persons  who are privy to price or trade sensitive information relating  to the Group. Under the policy, persons who are included in  the privy persons lists will be reminded not to trade in Singtel  securities while in possession of unpublished price or trade  sensitive information. In relation to the shares of other companies, Directors are  prohibited from trading in shares of Singtel’s listed associates  when in possession of unpublished price or trade sensitive  information relating to such associates. Directors are also to  refrain from having any direct or indirect financial interest in  Singtel’s competitors that might or might appear to create a  conflict of interest or affect the decisions Directors make on  behalf of Singtel. Continuous disclosure There are formal policies and procedures to ensure that  Singtel complies with its disclosure obligations under the  SGX Listing Manual. A Market Disclosure Committee is  responsible for Singtel’s Market Disclosure Policy. The policy  contains guidelines and procedures for internal reporting  and decision-making with regard to the disclosure of  material information. No material contracts Since the end of the previous financial year ended 31 March  2023, no material contracts involving the interest of the  Group CEO, any Director, or the controlling shareholder,  Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, has been entered into  by Singtel or any of its subsidiaries, and no such contract  subsisted as at 31 March 2024, save as may be disclosed on  SGXNet or herein. Interested person transactions  Singtel has established policies and procedures to govern  the approval and entry of interested person transactions  (IPT) to ensure they are entered at arm’s length including  comparison against market rates and competitive quotes  where available. Interested person transactions are regularly  reviewed by the AC in accordance with the requirements of  Chapter 9 of the SGX Listing Manual. Where any IPT requires  shareholders’ approval, the interested person will abstain  from voting and the decision will be made by disinterested  shareholders. Singtel IA regularly reviews the IPT entered into by the Group  to verify the accuracy and completeness of the IPT disclosure  and ensure compliance with the SGX reporting requirements  under Chapter 9 of the SGX Listing Manual. The report is  submitted to the AC for review. On 25 May 2023, Singtel announced that it had entered into a  conditional power purchase agreement with Sembcorp Power  Pte Ltd (the “PPA”) for the supply of electricity for a ten (10)  year contract period starting 1 October 2023. As Sembcorp  Power Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sembcorp  Industries Limited, was an associate of Singtel’s controlling  shareholder Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, the entry into  the PPA was an IPT as defined under Chapter 9 of the SGX  Listing Manual. Given that the annual contract sum under the  PPA exceeded 5% of the audited consolidated net tangible  61 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 64 ===== assets of the Singtel Group as at 31 March 2023, shareholders  approval for the entry into the PPA was sought and obtained  at the 31st Annual General Meeting of Singtel on 28 July 2023.  The AC had sought the opinion of Ernst & Young Corporate  Finance (EYCF) as independent financial advisor in relation to  the PPA. After considering the terms of the PPA as well as the  opinion of EYCF, the AC came to the view that the PPA was on  normal commercial terms and not prejudicial to the interest of  the Company and its minority shareholders.  As part of their onboarding, new Board members disclose  their associates and interests in entities that may transact  with Group entities. These disclosures are updated regularly.  The extent of transactions between the Group and Directors  (including their associates and entities in which they have  an interest) is reviewed by the CGNC in the context of the  annual Directors’ independence review. The Board has adopted a policy that there should be no  loans to Directors, except for loans to fund expenditure  to defend Directors in legal or regulatory proceedings, as  permitted under the Companies Act 1967. As at 31 March  2024, there was no loan granted to Directors. Details of IPT entered into by the Group are disclosed in this  Annual Report on page 233. Codes of conduct and practice  The Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and  Ethics as a means to guide the Directors on the areas of  ethical risk, and help nurture an environment where integrity  and accountability are key. The Code of Business Conduct  and Ethics includes the following key principles: •	 Directors must avoid situations in which their own  personal or business interests directly or indirectly  conflict, or appear to conflict with the interests of Singtel; •	 Directors are to exercise due care and maintain the  confidentiality of information entrusted to them by Singtel  or other parties who have business dealings with the  Company; and •	 Directors must at all time act honestly and use  reasonable diligence in the discharge of their duties of  their office. The Board also has a Directors’ Manual, which sets out  specific Board governance policies and practices and the  Directors’ duties and responsibilities. In addition, Singtel has  a code of internal corporate governance practices, policy  statements and standards (Singtel Code), and makes this  available to Board members as well as employees of the  Group. The principles, policies, standards and practices  in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the Directors’  Manual and the Singtel Code are intended to enhance  investor confidence and rapport, and to ensure that  decision-making is properly carried out in the best interests  of the Group. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the  Directors’ Manual and the Singtel Code are maintained by  the Company Secretary and are provided to Directors when  they are appointed to the Board. Singtel also has a strict Code of Conduct that applies to all  employees (Employee Code). The Employee Code sets out  principles to guide employees in carrying out their duties  and responsibilities to the highest standards of personal  and corporate integrity when dealing with Singtel, its  competitors, customers, suppliers and the community. The  Employee Code covers areas such as equal opportunity  employment practices, anti-discrimination and workplace  harassment, workplace health and safety, conduct in the  workplace, ethical business conduct when dealing with  external parties, protection of Singtel’s assets, proprietary  information and intellectual property, data protection,  confidentiality and conflicts of interest. Singtel adopts a zero tolerance approach to bribery and  corruption in any form and this is set out in the Employee  Code as well as the Singtel Group Anti-Bribery and  Corruption Policy (ABC Policy). The Employee Code and  the ABC Policy are posted on Singtel’s internal website  and a summarised version of the Employee Code, as  well as the ABC Policy, are accessible from the Singtel  corporate website. The Employee Code and ABC Policy  are supplemented by various internal procedures and  guidelines in key areas of Gifts & Hospitality, Donations,  Sponsorships, Investigations, Employee Grievance Reporting,  Whistleblowing, etc. which provide clear stipulations to guide  employees in carrying out their daily tasks. In the financial  year ended 31 March 2024, we continue to uplift our ABC  programme and initiatives based on the ABC framework  developed in FY2023. Details can be found on pages 61 to 63  of the Sustainability Report 2024.  Singtel has established an escalation process so that the  Board of Directors, Senior Management, and internal and  external auditors are kept informed of corporate crises in a  timely manner, according to their severity. Such crises may  include violations of the code of conduct and/or applicable  laws and regulations, as well as loss events that have or are  expected to have a significant impact, financial or otherwise,  on the Group’s business and operations. Corporate Governance 62  ===== PAGE 65 ===== Whistleblower policy  Whistleblower reporting is an important channel for  uncovering potential or actual misconduct, fraud,  corruption and other illegal or unethical activities that  affect Singtel. A robust whistleblower process significantly  contributes to strong corporate governance. Singtel’s  whistleblower policy provides safe channels for employees  and external parties to report suspected wrongdoing  without fear of retaliation. The policy specifies authorised  recipients for complaints, including direct reporting lines  to Internal Audit and independent whistleblower hotline  services managed by external service providers, ensuring  both transparency of complaint handling and protection of  whistleblowers. The policy’s key features are: •	 whistleblowers are encouraged to report their concerns   if they have reasonable grounds for suspicion;  •	 employees and other persons making reports will be  treated fairly and, to the extent possible, protected from  reprisal, retaliation and detrimental conduct;  •	 whistleblowers can report matters anonymously, but if  they choose to disclose their identity, the policy requires  confidentiality to be maintained at all times to protect  their identity; •	 all complaints will be investigated in an objective  manner by an independent team that has appropriate  skills and knowledge, following a structured process to  ensure proper conduct of investigations; •	 the outcome of each whistleblower investigation and  the follow-up actions taken are reported to the AC; and  •	 the adequacy of the whistleblower policy and the  underlying processes are reviewed annually and  reported to the AC for review and approval. The review  includes identifying changes to keep our whistleblower  policy in line with best practices and ongoing  compliance with both current and any upcoming  changes to regulatory requirements. The whistleblower policy is promoted during staff training  and through periodic communications (such as broadcast  emails and articles on internal communication channels)  to all staff. These initiatives form part of the Group’s  commitment to promote fraud and control awareness,  as well as promoting strong ethical values. In addition,  a summary of the whistleblower policy, including the  reporting mechanisms available to employees and external  parties, is publicly available on Singtel Group company  websites for transparency. Remuneration Matters The broad principles that guide the ERCC in its administration  of fees, benefits, remuneration and incentives for the Board of  Directors and Senior Management are set out below. Remuneration of non-executive Directors Singtel’s Group CEO is an executive Director and is therefore  remunerated as part of Senior Management. He does not  receive Director’s fees. The ERCC recommends the non-executive Directors’ fees for  the Board’s endorsement and approval by shareholders. To  ensure that the fees are fair, competitive and appropriate,  the fees are referenced against comparable benchmarks. Singtel seeks shareholders’ approval at the AGM for  Directors’ fees on a current year basis. The fees are paid on  a half-yearly basis in arrears. No Director can decide his or  her own fees. Directors are reimbursed for out-of-pocket  travelling and accommodation expenses should they need to  travel out of their country or city of residence to attend Board  and Board Committee meetings and other Board events. Save as mentioned below, there are no retirement benefit  schemes or share-based compensation schemes in place for  non-executive Directors. Directors are encouraged, but not required, to acquire  Singtel shares each year from the open market until they  hold the equivalent of one year’s fees in shares, and to  continue to hold the equivalent of one year’s fees in shares  while they remain on the Board. Financial year ended 31 March 2024 For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (FY2024), the  fees for non-executive Directors comprised a basic retainer  fee, additional fees for appointment to Board Committees  and attendance fees for Board and Board Committee  meetings. The framework for non-executive Directors’ fees  for FY2024 is set out on pages 66 to 67. There is no employee of the Group who is an immediate  family member of a Director or the Group CEO, and   whose remuneration exceeded S$100,000 during FY2024.   No employee of the Group is a substantial shareholder of   the Company. 63 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Directors’ fees paid for the financial year ended 31 March 2024 The aggregate Directors’ fees paid to non-executive Directors for FY2024 was S$3,926,526 (details are set out in the table below).

However, Mr Lee Theng Kiat  requested to receive, and was paid, the lower amount of S$960,000 in Chairman’s fees for FY2024. He also received car-related benefits (S$16,511)   for FY2024. (2)	 Mr John Arthur ceased to be a member of the Audit Committee with effect from 1 October 2023. In addition to the Director’s fees set out above,   Mr Arthur received fees of S$64,000 from NCS Pte. Ltd. (NCS) and has a fee of S$27,258 payable by Singtel Optus Pty Limited (Optus) for his roles as   a director. Both NCS and Optus are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Singtel. (3)	 In addition to the Director’s fees set out above, Mr Lim received fees of S$452,833 for his roles as: (i) chairman of the Executive Committee of NCS,   from 1 April 2023 to 29 February 2024, and (ii) chairman of the Board of Directors of NCS, from 1 March 2024 to 31 March 2024. (4)	 Ms Tan Tze Gay was appointed to the Executive Resource and Compensation Committee on 23 May 2023. (5)	 In addition to the Director’s fees set out above, Ms Yong received fees of S$23,750 in her capacity as a director of Nxera Investment Holdings Pte. Ltd.,   a subsidiary of Singtel. (6)	 Mr Bradley Horowitz stepped down from the Board following the conclusion of the AGM on 28 July 2023. Corporate Governance 64  ===== PAGE 67 ===== Financial year ending 31 March 2025  For the financial year ending 31 March 2025 (FY2025), it is  proposed that aggregate fees of up to S$4,600,000 (FY2024:  up to S$4,600,000) be paid to Directors. The proposed  remuneration framework for the non-executive Directors  (including the Chairman) for FY2025 remains unchanged  from the framework for FY2024.  Under the remuneration framework for the non-executive  Directors for FY2025, the all-in Chairman’s fee is S$1,150,000.  However Mr Lee Theng Kiat has requested to receive the  lower amount of S$960,000 in Chairman’s fees for FY2025.  Mr Lee also requested to receive, and was paid, the lower  amount of S$960,000 in Chairman’s fees for FY2024.  The proposed all-in Chairman’s fee for FY2025 takes into  account: •	 the significant leadership role played by the Chairman of  the Board, and in providing clear oversight and guidance  to management; •	 the amount of time the Chairman spends on Singtel  matters, including providing input and guidance on  strategy and supporting Management in engaging with  a wide range of other stakeholders such as partners,  governments and regulators, as well as travelling to visit  the Group’s key associates in the region. In this regard,  the Board has agreed with the Chairman that he will  commit a significant proportion of his time to his role as  Chairman of the Board and will manage his other time  commitments accordingly; and  •	 comparable benchmarks from Singapore-listed  companies. The proposed all-in Chairman’s fee will be paid approximately  two-thirds in cash and approximately one-third in Singtel  shares to be delivered in the form of a share award to be   granted under the Singtel Performance Share Plan 2012.   The actual number of shares to be awarded will be  determined by reference to the volume-weighted average  price of a share on the SGX over the 10 trading days  immediately following the date of the 32nd Annual General  Meeting, rounded down to the nearest share. The award will  consist of fully paid shares, with no performance conditions  attached and no vesting periods imposed, but it is currently  intended that there will be a moratorium on the sale of such  shares for a period of up to two years after the grant of the  award. No separate retainer fees, Board Committee fees or  attendance fees will be paid to the Chairman. The quantum of Directors’ fees for the non-executive  Directors (other than the Chairman) for FY2025 are  calculated based on, among other things, the number of  expected Board and Board Committee meetings and the  number of Directors expected to hold office during that year. Shareholders’ approval is required for the Directors’ fees  pursuant to the Companies Act 1967 of Singapore and the  Constitution of the Company. The framework for non-executive Directors' fees for FY2025  is set out on pages 66 to 67. 65 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 68 ===== Directors’ fee structure for the financial year ended 31 March 2024 and the proposed structure for the financial year  ending 31 March 2025  FY2024 (S$ per annum) FY2025 (proposed) (S$ per annum) Basic Retainer Fee Board Chairman (all-in fees) 1,150,000 (1) 1,150,000 (1) Lead Independent Director 144,000 144,000 Director 120,000 120,000 Audit Committee Committee chairman  70,000 70,000 Committee member 45,000 45,000 Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee Committee chairman  45,000 45,000 Committee member 30,000 30,000 Executive Resource and Compensation Committee Committee chairman  70,000 70,000 Committee member 45,000 45,000 Finance and Investment Committee Committee chairman  70,000 70,000 Committee member 45,000 45,000 Risk and Sustainability Committee Committee chairman  70,000 70,000 Committee member 45,000 45,000 Technology and Resilience Committee Committee chairman  70,000 70,000 Committee member 45,000 45,000 Optus Advisory Committee (2) Committee chairman  45,000 - Committee member 30,000 - Other Committee/Panel Committee/Panel chairman  45,000 45,000 Committee/Panel member 30,000 30,000 Notes: (1)	 The all-in Chairman’s fee is S$1,150,000.

Alignment with shareholders’ interests •	 Align interests between management and  shareholders •	 Select appropriate performance metrics for   annual and long-term incentive plans to support  business strategies and ongoing enhancement of   shareholder value •	 Allow for performance-related clawback if long-term  sustained performance targets are not met •	 Establish sound and structured funding to ensure  affordability Pay-for-performance • 	 Measure performance based on a holistic balanced  scorecard approach, comprising both financial and  non-financial metrics •	 Ensure targets are appropriately set for threshold,  target, stretch and exceptional performance levels Fair and appropriate •	 Offer competitive packages to attract and retain  highly experienced and talented individuals •	 Link a significant proportion of remuneration to  performance, both on an annual and long-term basis •	 Structure a significant but appropriate proportion of  remuneration to be at risk with symmetric upside   and downside Effective implementation •	 Ensure the link between performance and  remuneration is clear and the framework is simple   for employees to understand •	 Meet rigorous corporate governance requirements Remuneration Report Our remuneration strategy is designed to attract, motivate and retain employees to support our strategy, reinforce our  culture and values and deliver sustainable shareholder value.  67 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 70 ===== Remuneration governance The effectiveness of our remuneration strategy is  underpinned by robust governance. The ERCC reviews  remuneration of Senior Management through a process  that considers Group, Operating Companies and individual  performance as well as relevant comparative remuneration  in the market. On an annual basis, the ERCC oversees the  setting of performance measures and targets for variable  incentives, reviews the setting and assessment of each   senior executive's KPIs and proposes the remuneration  of the Senior Management for the Board’s approval. In  determining the remuneration recommendations, ERCC   will consider a range of factors, including but not limited   to internal and external relativity for roles of similar size  and complexity, individual’s performance, contributions and  experience. For the role of Group Chief Internal Auditor,   the chairman of the Audit Committee assesses his  performance and approves his remuneration annually. Engagement with consultants  During the year, the ERCC appointed an independent  remuneration consultant, Willis Towers Watson, to conduct  a comprehensive review of the overall remuneration  framework to ensure continued relevance to our strategic  business objectives and alignment with market practice.  Arising from the review, we have made some revisions to  the remuneration framework with the objectives of driving  alignment with Singtel Group’s go-forward business  strategies while reinforcing our commitment to deliver  sustainable shareholder value and Environment, Social,  and Governance (ESG) priorities. The Performance Share  Award (PSA) is reintroduced as a variable component in the  remuneration structure for Senior Management. PSA was  suspended for Senior Management from 2021 to 2023 as  they were granted a One-Off Long Term Incentive Award in  2021 designed to support Singtel’s transformation agenda  and enhance alignment with long-term shareholder value  creation. For the PSA, the performance measures selected  are key drivers for shareholder value creation, growth and  capital efficiency and commitment to ESG priorities.  Apart from key revisions introduced, the review showed that  other aspects of our remuneration framework remained  relevant and aligned to market practice.  The ERCC also appointed Willis Towers Watson to conduct  Executive Remuneration Benchmarking for Senior  Management. As part of the study, Willis Towers Watson  benchmarked the Senior Management’s remuneration  against comparable peer groups comprising Singapore- listed companies as well as regional and global peers in the  relevant industries. A pay-for-performance analysis was also  done to review the correlation between the Group CEO’s  remuneration, key financial results and total shareholder  returns over a five-year period, relative to Singapore- listed peer companies. Overall, the study found that the  Group CEO’s remuneration is aligned with the company’s  performance relative to peers. As for the valuation and vesting computation for the  Restricted Share Award and Performance Share Award  grants under the Singtel Performance Share Plan 2012,   the ERCC has engaged Aon Hewitt Singapore Pte Ltd   (Aon Hewitt) for the services.  Willis Towers Watson, Aon Hewitt and their consultants   are independent and not related to the Group or any of  its Directors. Singtel may, under special circumstances, compensate  senior executive for their past contributions when their  services are no longer needed, in line with market  practice; for example, due to redundancies arising from  reorganisation or restructuring of the Group. If a senior executive is involved in misconduct or fraud,  resulting in financial loss to the company, the ERCC has the  discretion not to award and to forfeit incentive components  of the individual's remuneration, to the extent that such  award or incentive has not been released or disbursed. Remuneration framework Our remuneration framework is designed to incentivise  Senior Management to deliver the Group’s strategic  priorities, reinforce our culture and values and enhance  shareholder value over the medium and long term. Balanced Scorecard Targets Setting  We use a balanced scorecard approach to measure how  successful we are in serving stakeholders and executing   our short to long-term strategy. Our scorecard comprises   key financial and non-financial performance indicators  (KPIs) in five broad categories: Breakthrough, Financial,  Operational, People and ESG. ESG KPIs have been  established in the balanced scorecard since 2021 to foster  greater accountability and ownership across the company.   For more details on our sustainability goals and initiatives,  please refer to the Group Sustainability Report 2024. Using a balanced scorecard approach, the KPIs are  determined annually based on alignment to the   longer-term strategic priorities and annual operating  plan. Weightings are allocated to KPIs for each senior  executive to ensure a balanced approach in assessing  individual’s performance and determining the appropriate  remuneration. At the start of each financial year, KPIs   for the Senior Management are endorsed by the ERCC   and approved by the Board.  Corporate Governance 68  ===== PAGE 71 ===== Performance Assessment and Remuneration Outcome At the end of the financial year, the ERCC assesses each  senior executive's performance, taking into consideration  the Group CEO's assessment of his direct reports and the  achievements based on a mix of financial and non-financial  outcomes as per the balanced scorecard. This includes  progress made towards the Group’s strategic priorities,  leadership behaviours and demonstration of the Group’s  core values. Based on these quantitative and qualitative  considerations, the ERCC reviews and recommends the  appropriate performance level for each senior executive   for the Board’s approval. In relation to the performance assessment, the ERCC also  reviews and recommends the remuneration of Senior  Management for the Board’s approval. In determining the  remuneration recommendations, the ERCC considers a  range of factors, including a broader performance overlay  beyond scorecard measures and benchmarking study by   the appointed independent consultant.  Variable Incentives Targets Setting and Outcomes Each year, the ERCC reviews and approves the targets and  performance conditions of variable incentive plans, and  evaluates the formulaic outcomes based on the achievement  against predetermined targets and performance conditions.  The ERCC has the discretion to adjust the outcome to ensure  reasonableness and appropriateness and is guided by an  established set of principles in its considerations.  Remuneration Components Our total remuneration provides an appropriate balance  between fixed and variable components, in line with our  pay-for-performance principle. The remuneration structure  is such that the proportion of the variable components  increases for the more senior levels to reflect their greater  accountabilities and impact on business performance.  In addition, a significant portion of the remuneration of   our Senior Management is delivered in Singtel shares to  ensure that their interests are aligned with shareholders.  For more senior executives, their remuneration structure  has a higher weighting on Performance Share Award (PSA)  to drive the long-term performance for the company and  increase focus on shareholder returns. An overview of  the remuneration components for Senior Management is  indicated in the diagram below.

Approve by the Board based on ERCC’s recommendation and review  annually against: •	 Peers of similar financial size and complexity to the Group and  Operating Companies •	 Internal relativity •	 Individual’s contributions and experience •	 Economic conditions In Australia, consistent with local market practice, Senior Management  may opt for a portion of their salaries to be received in benefits-in-kind,   such as superannuation contributions and motor vehicles, while  maintaining the same overall cost to the company. Benefits &   Provident/   Superannuation  Fund Provisions are in line  with local market  practices and legislative  requirements, and  not directly linked to  performance. Contribute towards the Singapore Central Provident Fund or the Optus  Superannuation Fund or any other chosen fund, as applicable. Provide in-company medical scheme, club membership, employee  discounts and other benefits that may incur Australian Fringe Benefits Tax,  where applicable.   Participation in benefits is dependent on the country in which the senior  executive is located. For expatriates located away from home, additional  benefits such as accommodation, children’s education and tax equalisation  may be provided. Variable remuneration The variable remuneration for Senior Management comprises performance bonus given in the form of cash bonus and  deferred shares, and performance shares. Details of the components are outlined in the following segments.  Component Purpose and Description Performance  Bonus •	 Cash Bonus •	 Deferred Shares  in the form of  Restricted Share  Award (RSA) •	 Reward for performance against annual targets set in the balanced  scorecard for each senior executive.  •	 Performance Bonus payout vary based on achievement against Group,  Operating Companies and individual performance targets. It comprises: 	 (A)	 a cash bonus that is paid out annually; and (B)	 deferred shares given in the form of RSA that vest in equal   parts over three years, subject to continued employment with  Singtel Group at the point of vesting. Time-based RSA is given   to encourage retention and drive alignment with shareholder  value creation.  Performance  Shares Performance Share  Award (PSA) •	 Reinforce the delivery of longer-term performance measures and  achievement of the Group’s strategic ambitions, with a focus on  sustainable shareholder value creation, growth and capital efficiency  and ESG priorities.  •	 PSA is subject to performance testing against predetermined stretched  targets. Vesting is conditional on achievement of stretched targets at the  end of a three-year performance period. Performance conditions and  vesting outcomes are reviewed and approved by ERCC annually.  Corporate Governance 70  ===== PAGE 73 ===== All shares awards in the form of RSA and PSA are provisionally granted to employees based on performance at the end of  each financial year at the discretion of the ERCC. The number of shares awarded under RSA and PSA is determined using   the valuation of the shares based on a Monte-Carlo simulation.  2024 Performance Share Award (PSA) Performance Measures and Vesting Level: Arising from the recent review of the remuneration framework, the 2024 PSA performance measures and weightings have  been set to incentivise the delivery of the Group and Operating Companies’ strategic priorities from 1 April 2024 to 31 March  2027. Targets have been set to balance stretch and achievability so that the awards act as an effective incentive for Senior  Management, and incentivise outperformance, aligned to our strategic priorities.  Performance Measures for Singtel Group and Operating Companies: Performance Measures for   Singtel Group Weighting Performance Measures for   Operating Companies Weighting Singtel Group’s Absolute Total Shareholder  Return (TSR) measured as a multiple of   Cost of Equity against predetermined targets 60% Singtel Group’s Absolute Total Shareholder  Return (TSR) measured as a multiple of   Cost of Equity against predetermined targets 20% Singtel Group’s Return on Invested   Capital (ROIC) achieved against  predetermined targets 20% Operating Company’s Return on Invested  Capital (ROIC) or Asset Yield achieved against  predetermined targets 60% Singtel Group’s ESG measures against  predetermined targets 20% Singtel Group’s ESG measures against  predetermined targets 20% Vesting Level: Absolute TSR Growth and Capital Efficiency (ROIC or Asset Yield) ESG Measures Performance Vesting Level (1) Performance Vesting Level (1) Performance Vesting Level (1) Superior  150% Superior  150% Superior  150% Target 100% Target 100% Target 100% Threshold 50% Threshold 50% Threshold 50% Below Threshold 0% Below Threshold 0% Below Threshold 0% Note: (1)	  For achievement between these performance levels, the percentage of shares that will vest would vary accordingly. Minimum Shareholding Requirement To further align the interests of Senior Management with shareholders, they are required to build up and retain at least the  equivalent of two times their annual base salary in shares. The Group CEO is expected to hold at least the equivalent of   three times his annual base salary as shareholding. Treatment of Awards on Cessation of Employment Special provisions for vesting and lapsing of awards apply for events such as the termination of employment, misconduct,  retirement and any other events approved by the ERCC. Upon occurrence of any of the events, the ERCC will consider, at its  discretion, whether or not to release any award, and will take into account circumstances on a case-by-case basis, including  (but not limited to) the contributions made by the employee. 71 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 74 ===== Performance share award vesting outcome for the year Performance conditions for 2021 PSA were tested following the conclusion of the three-year performance period from  1 April 2021 to 31 March 2024. In determining the Singtel Group’s Reported NPAT achievement against predetermined targets,  the ERCC has carefully considered the formulaic outcome and applied discretion on an exceptional basis to exclude the  impact of non-cash impairment provision on the goodwill of Optus for the financial year ended 31 March 2024. Overall, as  performance conditions were partially met, the vesting outcome for 2021 PSA is 52%. Details of the 2021 PSA vesting conditions  and outcomes are outlined in the table below. 2021 PSA Performance Period: 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2024 KPI Vesting Conditions Weighting Vesting Outcome % Singtel Group’s Absolute Total Shareholder Return achieved against   predetermined targets 60% 0% Singtel Group’s Reported NPAT achieved against predetermined targets 20% 150% Singtel Group's ESG measures against predetermined targets 20% 109.9% Overall outcome 52% Note: (1) 	 Senior Management were not granted 2021 PSA. Separate one-off long-term incentive award to drive transformation In 2021, a separate long-term incentive (LTI) award with a five-year performance period was introduced. This is a One-Off   LTI Award designed to support Singtel’s transformation agenda, enhance alignment with long-term shareholder value  creation, and to retain and motivate the senior executive team. For the Senior Management who were granted the One-Off LTI Award in 2021, they were not granted 2021 to 2023 PSA. Key features of the One-Off LTI Award are outlined below. Component Purpose and Description One-Off LTI Award •	 Support Singtel’s transformation agenda, enhance alignment with long-term shareholder value  creation, and to retain and motivate the senior executive team. •	 Has a five-year performance period (1 April 2021 to 31 March 2026) based on the following  performance measures: Performance Measure Weighting Singtel Group’s five-year Absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measured  as a multiple of Cost of Equity against predetermined targets 80% Singtel Group’s ESG measures against predetermined targets 20% •	 To incentivise senior executives towards earlier achievement of the five-year targets, this LTI  plan has a milestone vesting feature, where 15% would vest after Year 3 or Year 4 if the five-year  Absolute TSR performance threshold is achieved by then, and another 15% would vest 12 months  later, subject to ERCC’s approval. The milestone vesting is also subject to Singtel’s Absolute TSR  exceeding the combination of the median TSR of the Straits Times Index (50%) and the MSCI  Asia (excluding Japan) Telco Index (50%). The remaining 70% would then be subject to final  performance testing after Year 5 if the milestone vesting has been achieved. •	 Similar to the RSA and PSA, the number of shares awarded is determined using the valuation  of the shares based on a Monte-Carlo Simulation. The performance conditions and targets are  approved by the ERCC. The prevailing treatment of awards on cessation of employment will  continue to apply for this one-off share award.

Milestone Vesting Outcome for One-Off LTI Award: Based on the three-year performance period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2024, there is no milestone vesting for the One-Off  LTI Award as the Singtel Group's Absolute TSR performance threshold was not met. Remuneration of key management For the financial year ended 31 March 2024, there were no termination, retirement and post-employment benefits granted to  Directors and Key Management disclosed herein.  Remuneration of Group CEO  Since assuming the role of Group CEO in January 2021, Yuen Kuan Moon has led the Singtel Group on a three-year strategic  reset to transform the organisation.  For FY2024, the Group has delivered resilient results with underlying net profit up 10% to S$2.26 billion. In the connectivity  business, the consumer and enterprise units were merged in both Singtel Singapore and Optus to drive synergies and  innovation, make cost improvements and boost the competitiveness of both companies in a sector facing structural declines.  New growth engines were identified and scaled in both the ICT and data centre space, with NCS and Nxera expanding into  the region. In the regional associate markets, the Group has repositioned for new opportunities in the emerging area of fixed  mobile convergence by integrating IndiHome with Telkomsel in Indonesia and 3BB with AIS in Thailand. The Group has raised  S$8 billion in the last three years through its capital recycling programme to fund growth opportunities and return excess  capital to shareholders through the value realisation dividend. The Group has executed well in championing people and sustainability. With the BIG culture resonating with employees, our  employee engagement reached a record 75%, which puts Singtel on par with companies in the global top quartile based on  Kincentric’s survey. In addition, the Group has invested some S$20 million a year to help employees reskill and upskill for the  digital economy. On the sustainability front, the Group deepened its commitments to climate action, becoming Asia’s first  telco to bring forward its net-zero goal to 2045 and renew its science-based targets with SBTi. Singtel was accorded the top  ‘A’ rating by CDP, being the first telco in Southeast Asia to achieve this rating. Under Yuen Kuan Moon’s leadership, the Group has sharpened its business focus, made significant operational improvements  and executed to a proven capital recycling programme to build a strong foundation to move to its next phase of growth. The  Group has introduced Singtel28, a new growth plan designed to enhance customer experiences and deliver sustained value  realisation for shareholders. 73 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 76 ===== Breakdown of remuneration for Group CEO for the financial year ended 31 March 2024: The ERCC and Board have reviewed Yuen Kuan Moon’s performance for the year and approved his remuneration as outlined  below.

The strategic reset has laid a strong  foundation for us to build on as we embark on Singtel28,  with the Group now primed to deliver growth and sustained  value realisation. We will continue to communicate the new  growth plan and its deliverables in the new year. During the year, we engaged around 700 investors in more  than 120 virtual and in-person meetings, including group  and one-on-one meetings, investor conferences and global  roadshows. We hosted our annual Investor Day event and  organised tours at NCS’ Tesseract and DC West. This gave  investors a first-hand experience of NCS’ cutting-edge work  in AI and showcased why our data centres are one of the  greenest in the region. During these engagements, the key topics discussed  included competitive dynamics, improving our operations  in core markets, scaling our growth engines and recycling  capital. Investors were also keen to learn how we plan to  improve total shareholder returns and close the valuation  gap in our shares. As investors are placing greater emphasis on Environment,  Social and Governance (ESG) considerations in their   investment criteria, we have been having more conversations   about our sustainability strategy, efforts and progress to  aid their investment decisions. This also includes material  issues they have identified such as environmental impact  and climate change, data protection and sustainable  supply chain management. We also hosted our inaugural  sustainability forum which was attended by more than 400  customers, vendors, partners and investors. During the  forum, we unveiled our environmental sustainability strategy,  newly aligned with our evolved environmental ambitions and  refreshed set of SBTi-validated targets.    We continue to nurture and maintain strong links with sell-side  research analysts and are well-covered by close to 20 analysts  based in Singapore, Malaysia, India and the UK, who issue  regular reports. To ensure a two-way flow of information,  Singtel commissioned a survey of investors’ perceptions  to solicit feedback from the investment community on a  range of strategic and topical issues. The survey and regular  monitoring of analyst, industry and media reports, form part  of our holistic approach to gathering feedback and improving  disclosures and investor relation practices.  Retail investors form an important part of our outreach  efforts. This year, we actively participated in events hosted  by local brokerage houses and the Singapore Exchange  (SGX), where we helped both trading representatives and  retail investors understand our business better. The events  were well attended, and attendees found the opportunity   to interact with senior management particularly insightful.  We also leveraged digital channels such as social media  platforms to widen our reach to retail investors. A Thai Depository Receipt (DR) on Singtel was listed on  the Stock Exchange of Thailand on 1 April 2024, allowing  investors in the Thai market to readily access our shares.    We embarked on a series of investor and media  engagements to drum up interest and understanding of  Singtel’s value proposition for Thai investors. The listing   was well-received on a strong order book and volumes.  We have been a long-term sponsor of the Securities  Investors Association’s (Singapore) (SIAS) Investor   Education Programme and the annual SIAS-Singtel  dialogue provides a regular platform for us to communicate  our strategy and performance with retail shareholders.  Singtel shareholders are entitled to SIAS’ complimentary  associate membership as part of the sponsorship.   To sign up, they can visit our IR website or   https://sias.org.sg/membership/. Committed to lead in corporate governance,  transparency and investor relations Good corporate governance plays a vital role in shaping  investor perception of a company’s integrity, transparency,  accountability and efficiency. We keep abreast of the  latest developments and benchmark ourselves against   best practices in key areas such as financial reporting   and disclosure, board structure, shareholder rights   and remuneration. Singtel is a founding member of SGListCos, an association  for companies listed on the SGX. SGListCos is a thought  leadership and advocacy platform, providing a  representative voice when the SGX needs to sound out   new initiatives or review existing listing requirements.   The platform gave us an opportunity to provide feedback  on the incorporation of International Sustainability  Standards Board (ISSB) standards into SGX’s sustainability  reporting rules. 78  ===== PAGE 81 ===== IR Calendar of Events MAY 2023 •	 Citi Pan-Asia Regional Investor Conference 2023, Singapore •	 Non-deal Equity Roadshows, Singapore •	 UBS OneAsean Conference 2023, Singapore •	 Investor briefing: 5G & DC JUN 2023 •	 UBS Future-Now APAC Conference 2023, Singapore •	 Non-deal Equity Roadshows, United Kingdom and Europe JUL 2023 •	 31st Annual General Meeting, Singapore  AUG 2023 •	 Singtel Investor Day, Singapore •	 Singtel Explorer Tour, Singapore SEP 2023 •	 Investor briefing: KKR’s 20% investment stake   in Singtel’s regional data centre business  •	 Non-deal Equity Roadshows, United States OCT 2023 •	  Non-deal Equity Roadshows, Hong Kong NOV 2023 •	 Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific Summit 2023, Singapore •	 Non-deal Equity Roadshows, Singapore •	 Investor briefing: Optus update JAN 2024 •	 BofA ASEAN Conference 2024, Singapore •	 SIAS Corporate Connect MAR 2024 •	 UBS OneASEAN Summit 2024, Singapore •	 Macquarie Invest ASEAN Conference 2024, Australia  •	 DBSV Pulse of Asia Conference 2024, Singapore •	 Maybank Thai Depository Receipt  Singtel strongly encourages and supports shareholder  participation at general meetings.

Our risk  management framework sets out the governance structure  for managing risks, our risk philosophy, appetite, and  tolerance levels, as well as our risk management approach.  It is designed to enable the Group to comprehensively  identify, assess, and prioritise risks. This in turn allows us to  capitalise on emerging opportunities and proactively mitigate  potential impacts. We also seek continuous improvement and  refinement of our risk management process and practices  and embrace digitalisation and data analytics to stay ahead   in an ever-changing business landscape fraught with a  multitude of risks. Beyond the framework and process, we believe that risk  management is the collective responsibility for every employee  of our organisation.

We will continue to pursue business expansion in the emerging  markets, including acquiring controlling stakes in the associates and actively managing the risks. •	 The Group is prepared to take measured risks to seek new growth in the digital space by providing global platforms  and enablers, targeted at a global footprint, while leveraging our current scale and core strengths. • 	 The Group targets an investment grade credit rating and dividend payout policy consistent with our stated dividend  policy and guidance. Risk Management Process The effectiveness of our risk management policies and  processes is reviewed on a regular basis and, where  necessary, improved. The risk management processes  facilitate the alignment of our strategy and annual  operating plan with the management of key risks. Our  key risk management activities include identification,  assessment, prioritisation, mitigation, controls, monitoring,  communication, and review. Further, we are also focused  on scenario planning, business continuity management,  disaster recovery management, and crisis management.  The CEOs of our Operating Companies (OpCos)  submit an annual report on the key risks, controls, and  indicators for their respective OpCos to the Risk and  Sustainability Committee (RSC) for their concurrence.  Our Group CEO and Group CFO, with assurance from  the Management Committee members, provide an  annual written certification to the Board confirming the  integrity of financial reporting and the efficiency and  effectiveness of the risk management, internal control,  and compliance systems. 81 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 84 ===== The following represent the key risks for the Group: •	 Macro Events • 	 Regulatory, Compliance, and Legal •	 Market and Competition • 	 Network/DC Infrastructure •	 Information Technology and Cyber Security • 	 Financial Management •	 Vendor and Supply Chain • 	 Human Resources • 	 Environmental Sustainability •	 Ventures, Mergers, Acquisitions, and Partnerships Macro Events Weakened Global Outlook The global credit and equity markets have experienced  substantial dislocations, liquidity disruptions and market  corrections. These and other related events have had a  significant impact on economic growth and demand for  telecommunications, IT, digital and other related services  overall. Higher costs of living may result in reduced  discretionary spending on such services in the consumer  segment. The Group’s planning and management review  processes include keeping abreast of economic and  market developments; periodic monitoring of budgets  and expenditures to optimise the allocation and structure  of capital among its various businesses. We continue  to implement cost management and transformation  programmes to drive improvements in cost structures and  changes in the business model. Geopolitical Events Adverse geopolitical developments (e.g., Russia-Ukraine   war, Israel-Hamas war, US-China tension) could further  weaken global economic activity. They could also result in  significant impact to our businesses, such as supply chain  disruption and sanctions. We remain vigilant in monitoring  these developments and in proactively addressing any  risks. The Group will disclose any sanctions violation to SGX,  and other relevant authorities as required, in a timely and  accurate manner. Increases in Energy Costs Disruptions in trade and surging fuel prices could impact the  operating costs of our power infrastructure, facilities, and  data centres. We continue to engage energy consultants and  employ hedging strategies to reduce the impact of rising  energy prices on our businesses. Of note, we have signed  a 10-year fuel oil indexed power purchase agreement,  which will provide a more stable energy price to support  the Group’s current and future energy needs amidst the  energy market instability. The agreement also offers us the  opportunity to tap on additional existing solar resources to  support our green journey. We are also exploring energy- efficient solutions and adopting energy-saving measures,  such as harnessing on-site solar energy through installation  of solar photovoltaic systems. The Group’s Internal Audit (IA) function carries out reviews  and internal control advisory activities aligned to the  key risks in our businesses. This provides independent  assurance to the Audit Committee (AC) on the adequacy  and effectiveness of our risk management, financial  reporting processes, and internal control and compliance  systems. External auditors also review our material internal  controls, to the extent of the scope in their audit plans.   Any material non-compliance and internal control  weaknesses, together with their recommendations to  address them, are reported to the AC. Our Management,  with the assistance of Singtel IA, follows up on the auditors’  recommendations as part of their role in reviewing our  system of internal controls. The above are in place with the intent to provide  reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material  misstatements or loss, as well as to ensure the safeguarding  of assets, maintenance of proper accounting records,  reliability of financial information, compliance with  applicable legislation, regulations and best practices, and  the identification and management of business risks. Risk Factors The Group is subject to numerous risks, any one of which  could adversely affect our reputation, financial performance,  and operations. These risks vary widely and we aim to  mitigate the exposure through appropriate risk management  strategies and internal controls.  Risk Management Philosophy and Approach 82  ===== PAGE 85 ===== Regulatory, Compliance, and Legal Regulatory Risks  Our businesses depend on licences issued by government  authorities. Failure to meet regulatory requirements could  result in fines or other sanctions including, ultimately, the  revocation of licences. In addition, our businesses may  be required to obtain licences where they wish to expand  or enter new markets. Our operations are also subject to  various laws and regulations.  The regulatory landscape for the media and  telecommunications industry has seen changes, with  developments applicable to cyber security, data privacy  and consumer protection. These changes, together with  increasing scrutiny and regulators inclined to strong  enforcement actions, may lead to additional compliance  costs, and affect the long-term viability of our business.  In Singapore, key changes for 2024 include the Shared  Responsibility Framework for scam losses, dictating  the shared responsibility between financial institutions,  telecommunication operations, and consumers; the Online  Criminal Harms Act (OCHA), where the Group’s internet  service provider business may be subject to access block  directions; the Mar 2024 Law Enforcement and Other  Matters Bill, which makes it a criminal offence for mobile  service providers and/or their retailers to knowingly use any  person’s particulars for unauthorised registration of SIM  cards, or to perform registration of SIM cards with false or  misleading particulars; and the amended Cybersecurity  Act, which introduced requirements for foundational digital  infrastructure (e.g., cloud service providers and data centre  service providers) that support Singapore’s digital economy  and digital way of life, and increased reporting requirements  for critical information infrastructure (CII).  In both Singapore and Australia, the governments have  established regulatory regimes for critical infrastructure (CI),  which may adversely affect the way our businesses manage  and operate their networks when equipment is classified  as CI. Both Singapore and Australia are also impacted by  the implementation of national broadband networks. In  Singapore, the Infocomm Media Development Authority  (IMDA) has, in its implementation of the Next Generation  Nationwide Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN) and  introduction of various grants and subsidies, increased the  level of competition in the broadband market. In Australia,  the National Broadband Network has been established  as a government-owned entity, nbn Co, operated on  a wholesale-only open access basis. The Australian  government has also adopted security legislation which   can exclude equipment vendors from countries with certain  legal structures or powers from participating in the supply   of equipment for 5G infrastructure.  Our overseas investments are also subject to the risk  of imposition of laws and regulations restricting the  level, percentage and manner of foreign ownership  and investment, as well as the risk of nationalisation.  We have access to regulatory expertise and staffing  resources in Singapore and Australia and we work closely  with the various stakeholders and our partners in the  countries we operate in. We monitor new developments,  participate in discussions, and consult with regulatory  authorities on regulatory reforms and developments in  the telecommunications and media industry. In addition,  we conduct training and refresher sessions for staff and  Management to stay abreast of our regulatory obligations. Access to Spectrum  Access to spectrum is critically important for supporting  our business of providing mobile voice, data, and other  connectivity services. The use of spectrum in most countries  where we operate is regulated by government authorities  and requires licences. Failure to acquire access to spectrum,  or new or additional spectrum, on reasonable commercial  terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our  core communications business, financial performance and  growth plans.  Taxation Risks  Our Group has operations across many jurisdictions.  Consequently, we are subject to the tax regulations in the  respective jurisdictions. These regulations may include  changes and reforms arising from global tax developments  which we proactively monitor. The tax legislations or changes  in regulations may increase our compliance obligations  and business costs. Notwithstanding, we are committed  83 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 86 ===== to complying with the applicable tax laws in the countries  where we operate. The management and tolerance of tax  risks are guided by our tax risk management framework  (TRM Framework). The TRM Framework formalises our  tax governance practices, sets a co-ordinated approach  to identifying, managing, and mitigating tax risks, and  promotes responsible tax management. Material tax risks  and disputes are monitored and reported in a timely manner  in accordance with the TRM Framework, and appropriate  disclosures are made in our financial statements.   Litigation Risks  Our business may be involved from time to time in disputes  with various parties such as regulators, contractors,  suppliers, and customers, relating to, among other  things, the provision of services, certain transactions, the  development and maintenance of network infrastructure  or data breaches. Such disputes may lead to legal and  other proceedings, including for example, administrative  proceedings, fines, penalties, and/or class action lawsuits  in Australia. While the businesses consult with its legal  counsel and other experts on such matters, there is no  assurance that such regulatory or litigation actions will be  concluded or settled on favourable or reasonable terms,  or at all. Such actions may have a material effect on our  financial condition and earnings. Examples of such actions  are disclosed in the Notes to the Financial Statements under  “Contingent Liabilities”.  Data Protection and Privacy Risks Amidst a growing number of data breaches globally,  governments and regulators continue to introduce and  tighten privacy and cyber security laws to address the rising  threat to data privacy. In Singapore and Australia, regulators  have introduced higher financial penalties for data breaches  under the Personal Data Protection Act and the Privacy  Act respectively. As we digitalise our processes and share  data with business partners, we may be subjected to more  stringent regulatory obligations, fines, and other liabilities in  the event of a data breach. We seek to uphold the highest  standards of data privacy protection and cyber security  measures, as we further expand our digital businesses and  services. Continual effort is made to maintain strict internal  controls, governance process, conduct routine audits and  raising awareness among the staff. With the advent of Generative AI and AI-led technologies,  we see growing demand from our customers to explore  the immense potential and unlock related opportunities.  However, this exposes us to additional complexities and  implications, such as potential violation of privacy rights  through unintended generation of personal data or creation  of deepfakes. The Group has introduced an interim AI  policy to provide guidance and guardrails on responsible  AI usage while working towards a more comprehensive AI  Governance Framework. NCS has also developed its own  guidelines to govern different types of AI infrastructure to  ensure ethical and responsible use of Generative AI across  all its operations, for both personal and business uses. As  Generative AI evolves, we will continue to monitor this area  and work closely with regulatory and industry bodies to  achieve a balance between innovation and privacy.  Market and Competition  We face competition risks in all markets and business  segments in which we operate. Overview of Telecommunications Market The Group’s telco business models and profits are  challenged by disintermediation in the telecommunications  industry by handset providers and other digital service  providers and non-traditional telecommunications service  providers, including social media networks and over-the- top players which provide multimedia and video content,  applications, and services directly on demand. We invest  in our networks to ensure that they have the coverage,  capacity, and speed that will provide our customers with  the best network and connectivity experience. We are also  focused on driving efficiencies and innovation via new  connectivity technologies, products, services, processes,  and business models to meet evolving customer needs and  enhance customer experiences. Singtel Singapore Competition in the Singapore telecommunications market  remains intense among mobile network operators, mobile  virtual network operators (MVNOs), and eSIM providers/ resellers, depressing industry revenues. Further, Singapore’s  Next Gen NBN allows Retail Service Providers (RSPs) equal  and open access to NetLink Trust’s fibre network, which in  Risk Management Philosophy and Approach 84  ===== PAGE 87 ===== turn has increased competitive pressure in fixed broadband  and home services. In February 2024, the IMDA announced  it is allocating up to $100 million to upgrade its Nationwide  Broadband Network to 10 gigabytes per second (Gbps) to  support the increasing digitalisation in the country. This may  trigger price competition in the premium segment.  Business customers enjoy a wide range of service offerings,  including fixed, mobile, cloud, managed services and  hosting, IT services and consulting. Competitors include  multinational IT and telecommunications companies,  technology companies that introduce new communication  services as well as other non-traditional players. The  quality and prices of these services can influence a  potential business customer’s decision. Prices for some of  these services have declined significantly in recent years  because of capacity additions, technology innovations  and price competition. We continue to focus on offering  companies comprehensive and integrated information  and communications technology (ICT) and IT solutions  and initiatives to strengthen customer engagement. This  includes broadening our solution portfolio to cover new  areas of needs, such as cloud computing, multi-access  edge computing, software-defined network, managed  security services, quantum safe networking solutions, and  application programming interface (API) solutions for our  government and business customers. The dominance and sophistication of cloud infrastructure  by hyperscalers and increasing adoption of cloud-based  solutions by government and enterprise customers, are also  disruptive risks to our business. We continue to enhance our  cloud and digital service offerings, leveraging partnerships  and collaboration with the hyperscalers and other cloud  and digital technology service providers.  Optus In the Australian mobile market, in addition to the  incumbent operator and mergers of existing competitors,  several participants are subsidiaries of international groups  and operators and have made large investments which  are now sunk costs. We are, therefore, exposed to the risk  of irrational pricing being introduced by such competitors.  Our market share may also be at risk due to rapid growth  by industry competitors who may have a competitive cost or  network coverage advantage.  Business clients have access to a wide array of services,  ranging from fixed and mobile solutions to cloud- based offerings, managed services, and IT consultancy.  Our competition includes multinational IT giants,  telecom corporations, tech innovators venturing into  communication services, and non-traditional market  entrants. In recent years, we have witnessed a significant  drop in prices for certain services, owing to enhanced  capacity, technological breakthroughs, and intense price  competition. Our commitment lies in delivering holistic ICT  and IT solutions, bolstering client relationships. This entails  expanding our solution suite to encompass emerging  needs like cloud computing, multi-access edge computing,  software-defined networks, and tailored digital solutions  tailored for both government and corporate clientele. Hyperscale cloud infrastructures are also dominant in  Australia, and the rising acceptance of cloud-based  solutions among governmental bodies and corporate  clients pose significant disruptions to our operations. To  mitigate these risks, we persist in refining our cloud and  digital service portfolios, capitalising on alliances and  synergies with hyperscalers and various other cloud and  digital technology service providers. NCS With the acceleration of digital transformation in Asia  Pacific, NCS faces increased competition from both   new and existing local, regional, and global technology  service providers. It is imperative that we continuously  innovate and adjust to the changing needs of the   markets. At the same time, it will be important to focus   on serving our clients through differentiated offerings   and end-to-end technology services together with our   NCS NEXT capabilities in digital, data, cloud, and  platforms, as well as core offerings in application,  infrastructure, engineering, and cybersecurity. The global  shortage of digital talent is also driving organisations to  compete for talent and to invest in their differentiators  for talent attraction, development, and retention. We  continue to prioritise the development and retention of  our people, as well as attract the best talent, through a  comprehensive suite of recruitment, people development,  and culture-building programmes. 85 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 88 ===== Digital InfraCo Digital InfraCo operates in fragmented markets with  numerous competitors offering diverse services and of  varying reach. Furthermore, uncertain global economic  conditions may dampen enterprise demand, leading to  slower spending, extended decision-making processes,  and increased existing customer churn. The increasing  adoption of cloud-based technologies, or key customers  building their own data centres, could also adversely affect  demand for our data centres. If demand for capacity does  not keep up with increasing supply in the markets Digital  InfraCo operates in, this could result in depressed service  fees, adversely impacting our financial performance. The  ever-evolving nature of customer requirements across  technology and geographical needs can create challenges  if we fail to adapt and keep pace with our competitors,  potentially weakening our market position. To mitigate the  risk, we actively engage with our customers to ensure that  we move in lockstep with their needs. We constantly look to  develop and adopt new technology to bolster our offerings  in pursuit of product innovation and differentiation. We are  also open to exploring partnerships with strategic players  to expand our regional footprint and cater to customer  requirements that span beyond a single country. These  collaborations are differentiated based on factors like  strategic locations, access to power and renewable energy.  These measures ensure that we maintain our competitive  advantage in the markets we operate in. Regional Associates The operations of our regional associates’ businesses are  also subject to highly competitive market conditions. Their  growth depends in part on the adoption of mobile data  services in their markets. Some of these markets have and  could continue to experience intensifying price competition  for mobile data services from new, existing competitors, or  smaller scale competitors.  Network and DC Infrastructure 5G Risks In Singapore, Singtel Singapore was allocated radio  frequency spectrum and has deployed 5G networks  nationwide. In Australia, Optus has ramped up its 5G  deployment utilising mid-band spectrums and the low  band 900 MHz spectrum. Our regional associates are  similarly in various stages of rolling out 5G services.  However, the business case for investment in 5G network  and related systems has risks of uncertainty and may  be earnings dilutive. There may also be a long payback  period as 5G use cases and monetisation opportunities  have not been fully developed. The ability of equipment  and handset manufacturers to provide cost-efficient 5G  devices at scale also has direct impact on 5G adoption  and revenue. The existing high-quality 4G networks  may also limit the perceived value of 5G and impact its  monetisation potential. The progressive adoption of 5G  technology and solutions also introduces new challenges  relating to the quality and reliability of both network  capabilities and hardware, and may also introduce new  financial, technology and legal risks to our businesses. To  address these concerns, we are planning additional mobile  infrastructure investments as we streamline our 4G/5G  infrastructure. The planned shutdown of the 3G network in  both Singapore and Australia may carry unforeseen risks. In addition, the Australian government has implemented  security legislation to restrict vendors from certain countries  from participating in the supply of 5G network equipment  to mobile network operators. This limits the available  vendor sources and may lead to higher investment costs  and disruption to customers due to the need to replace  existing 4G equipment as well as higher 5G deployment  services costs. Infrastructure Failure  The telecommunications industry faces the constant  challenge of providing fast, secure, resilient, and reliable  infrastructure in an increasingly digital and connected world.  Risk Management Philosophy and Approach 86  ===== PAGE 89 ===== The provision of our services depends on the quality, stability,  resilience, and robustness of our infrastructure. We face the  risk of malfunction, loss, damage, interruptions, and other  adverse effects on our network and systems infrastructure  from natural or other uncontrollable events such as  deliberate acts of sabotage, acts of terrorism, or large- scale cyber-attacks. The occurrence of these risks would  have a materially adverse effect on our ability to deliver  services to customers. Additionally, some of the countries  in which we operate have experienced several major  natural catastrophes over the years, including typhoons,  droughts, floods, bushfires, and earthquakes. Some of these  catastrophes have also increased in intensity and frequency  due to climate change factors, causing prolonged and  exacerbated impact on our infrastructure and operations.  These risks could also potentially cause injury or death. We make significant investments in operational and  network resilience technology to make our infrastructure  more robust and fault-tolerant, and continually review our  processes and infrastructure to remove single-points of  failure and prevent any disruptions. We have implemented  key infrastructure diversity and redundancy measures to  prevent any downtime. We have implemented performance  monitoring systems, and emergency operation plans in our  facilities to respond to unexpected events. We have in place  an effective communication process for timely updates  to our stakeholders and customers during any incident or  crisis. There is a defined crisis management plan with a  clear escalation process to management in the event of  emergencies and catastrophic events. In addition, we have  business continuity plans and have taken up appropriate  insurance programmes and policies.  Digital Transformation of Services Our business units may face challenges from disruptive  technologies, new market entrants, and price-competitive  products as part of the new global digital landscape. With the  aggressive digitalisation of services in recent years, we have  accelerated our efforts to embrace rapid advancements in  wireless communications and new digital technologies such  as 5G, edge computing, artificial intelligence, application  programming interfaces, and cloud through a multi-year  plan to upgrade and refresh our technology to support  these developments. Our approach is to simplify, refresh,  and integrate our technology with innovations to generate  new business revenues and grow beyond the traditional  telecommunication services. We will continue to invest in new  technology, hire the right talent, develop strategic technology  partnerships, and deliver innovative products and services to  serve our customers, while keeping within our risk appetite  and meeting our regulatory obligations. However, we may incur substantial development expenditure  to adopt new or enabling technologies to pursue new growth  areas beyond the traditional telecommunications space.  It may also take time to see sustained returns from these  investments as we incur capital expenditure to transform our  technology over the coming years. The shortage of talent in  the technology sector, in addition to the costs of acquiring   new talent, also impacts our transformation efforts. To  manage this, we are investing in capability uplift of our  workforce complemented by our workforce strategy to enable  the execution of the organisation’s digital transformation.  Information Technology and Cybersecurity Information Technology Our businesses and operations rely heavily on IT  infrastructure and services. Proactive risk management  measures, including risk profiling, control assurance, and  governance to ensure management of risks, are in place.  Our investments in information security and cyber resilience  are focused on capability uplift and expanding the breadth  and depth of security monitoring. Further, as AI systems  become more capable and easily accessible, there is a  risk that AI will be used by malicious actors to circumvent  traditional cyber, scam, and spam controls. As such, we  will adapt our controls accordingly as we uplift our control  environment to manage such threats. 87 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 90 ===== Technology Obsolescence and Refresh With continuous advancement of technology, existing  software, systems, and/or equipment may be phased out  and reach their End of Life (EoL) and/or End of Support  (EoS) earlier than expected. Failure to monitor and respond  to EoL and EoS risks can materially and adversely affect  our business operations and may leave us vulnerable to  security threats such as malware and cyber-attacks. We  have in place a Technology Asset Management Framework  and continue to focus on managing, monitoring and  upgrading EoS and EoL components. We have embarked  on a multi-year technology refresh strategy, selecting  appropriate replacements for ageing infrastructure and  software to align with our evolving business objectives and  support future growth initiatives.  Cyber Security  Malicious cyber activity poses a risk to the Group, with  critical infrastructure networks globally being targeted  by cyber threat actors as part of information-gathering  campaigns or cyber-crime for financial gain. New  technologies, most notably the increased usage of AI, is  increasing the sophistication of tools available to cyber  threat actors. There has also been an increase in the  number of vulnerabilities identified in third-party products,  including those used to support our business operations  or serve our customers. This has included zero-day  vulnerabilities disclosed in third-party products, requiring  urgent action to remediate. In line with changes in the  threat landscape, we anticipate regulatory developments  in the countries that the Group operates in, and we are  engaging closely with the related regulatory bodies as part  of these developments. Across the Group, actions related to the associated cyber  security risks, which include managing the risks associated  with obsolete technology, third-party vendor provided  services and the adoption of AI technologies, are being  taken. In addition, we continually enhance our cyber  security controls, with the Group’s cyber security strategy  emphasising the investment in capabilities including identity  and access management, asset management, cyber  defence, vulnerability management, and security by design.   Financial Management  The main risks arising from our financial assets and  liabilities are foreign exchange, interest rate, market,  liquidity, access to financing sources and credit risks.  Financial market volatility may heighten execution risk for  funding activities and increase credit risk premiums for  market participants. We are exposed to foreign exchange  fluctuations from our operations, and from our associates  and joint ventures operating in foreign countries. These  relate to our dividend receipts and the translation of  the foreign currency earnings and carrying values of  our overseas operations. A significant portion of the  purchases and liabilities of associates and joint ventures  are denominated in foreign currencies versus the local  currency of the respective operations. This gives rise to  changes in cost structures and fair value gains or losses  when marked to market. We have established policies,  guidelines, and control procedures to manage and report  exposure to such risks. Our financial risk management  is discussed further on page 212 in Note 38 to the   Financial Statements.   Human Resources  Since April 2023, the Group has undergone significant  restructuring to drive growth, synergies, and productivity.  However, given the scale of the restructuring and right- sizing efforts, there are risks posed to our people’s  morale and our talent attraction/retention efforts,  including succession planning. Amidst the competitive  talent landscape, these risks can adversely impact our  business. In addition, the shortage of talent, especially  in the technology space, coupled with the rising costs of  acquiring new talent, continues to be a key concern as  we compete in the global marketplace. To ensure that  we have strong leadership, we identify, develop, and  build a sustainable pipeline of leaders for current and  future roles. To mitigate succession risks, a robust annual  succession planning review is conducted by the business  units and management, with the involvement of the Board  for senior leadership roles. This ensures that leadership  succession plans are current and future ready. We also  Risk Management Philosophy and Approach 88  ===== PAGE 91 ===== leverage internal and external talent pools to ensure talent  bench strength and provide confidence in our succession  pipelines. For leaders, we organise formal learning  activities, coaching, and mentoring, as well as provide  valuable learning experiences such as international  assignments, job rotations and special projects. We continue to invest in upskilling our existing workforce  and building up our current and emerging capabilities  through external professional hires and targeted  recruitment. To develop and retain talent, we conduct  regular skills assessments in critical business areas and  set out structured developmental roadmaps to fill new  and emerging skills gaps. We have also refreshed our HR  practices to promote internal career mobility, removing  barriers like tenure requirements and grade restrictions  for internal job applications. Our BIG Marketplace online  platform further enhances this mobility by connecting  employees with internal opportunities, projects, and  development resources, empowering them to take  charge of their career growth within our organisation.  We also continue to provide employees with flexible work  arrangements to encourage a strong sense of belonging.  Vendor and Supply Chain We rely on third-party vendors and service providers  and their extended supply chain in many aspects of our  business to serve our customers and support our business  operations, including, but not limited to, the design and  construction, operations and maintenance of our products,  infrastructure, applications, customer service operations,  content provision and customer acquisition. Accordingly,  the Group’s operations and reputation may be impacted  by third-party vendors or their supply chain if they fail to  operate in line with the Singtel Group Supplier Code of  Conduct and heightened expectations of key stakeholders  such as government, regulators, and customers on a  broadening set of Environmental, Social and Governance  (ESG) issues. These may include corporate governance and  business ethics, human rights, and modern slavery, as well  as climate change and environmental management. We  also conduct climate risk analysis to better understand and  manage climate risks affecting our suppliers. Amid global price inflation and vendor consolidation,   we are experiencing heightened costs from suppliers  and service providers, which could negatively impact  our business by increasing our capital and operating  expenditure. To bolster our resilience, we are actively  monitoring market trends, securing long-term contracts  with key vendors, and proactively diversifying our supplier  base as feasible. We also collaborate closely with vendors,  providing early forecasts for critical equipment needs,  and meticulously managing inventory levels to navigate  uncertainties effectively. Through these measures, we  aim to ensure operational continuity and fulfil customer  commitments amid turbulent external factors. We also monitor introductions and changes to legislation  and continue to make mandatory annual reporting required  by the Australian Modern Slavery Act. Optus is required to  publish a Modern Slavery Statement, which outlines the  actions taken to identify, mitigate, address and remediate  modern slavery risks in its operations and supply chain.  We monitor modern slavery and human rights risks within  our higher risk supplier categories and develop an action  plan for areas we can improve on, including updating our  e-learning modules to educate our people on this important  topic. Refer to our Group Sustainability Report and the Optus  Modern Slavery Statement for more details on how we  identify and address these risks and issues.  Environmental Sustainability  Electromagnetic Energy Risks  There is ongoing debate and research regarding the  potential health effects of electromagnetic fields and  radiation. While there is no substantiated evidence of public  health risks from exposure to electromagnetic energy  (EME) emitted from mobile phones and mobile transmission  equipment, perceived health risks can be a concern for  our customers, the community, and regulators. This could  translate to challenges or resistance to the implementation  of new, or upgrading of existing, mobile base stations  and micro-cells, which may impact the mobile coverage  in those localities and have resultant impact on the  mobile business. In addition, governments may introduce  regulations to address this perceived risk, which would  89 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 92 ===== affect our ability to deploy needed infrastructure. We could  also face reduced demand for mobile communications  services or litigation against us.  Notwithstanding, we design and deploy our network in  compliance with the relevant government mandated  EME standards. Our standards are based on the  recommendations of the International Commission on  Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), which is a  related agency of the World Health Organisation. The  ICNIRP standards are adopted by many countries and are  considered best practice. We continue to monitor research  findings on EME, health risks, and their implications on  relevant standards and regulations. Periodic tests and  routine auditing are performed on EME emission levels to  ensure we are in compliance with the standards. We will also  institute the necessary precautionary measures to safeguard  the health and safety of the public and our customers. Climate Change Risks Climate change is one of the key long-term global risks that  has the potential to impact our operations, infrastructure,  customers and supply chain. Apart from physical and  supply chain disruption risks arising from extreme weather  events, there are also other transitional risks as we move  towards a low-carbon economy and the achievement of  our 2030 Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and 2045  net-zero targets. These include risks associated with energy  security; greenwashing and reputation; loss of business due  to lagging climate initiatives; regulatory risks associated  with climate change in the form of stricter greenhouse gas  emission standards, carbon taxes, or changes in energy  prices; escalating costs; and scarcity of renewable energy  or accompanying infrastructure investments for adaptation  or mitigation. There are also growing market expectations  on our ability to fully achieve our aspiration to operate  sustainably and our provision of greener and more climate- resilient services. Investors and lenders also consider  our climate risks and progress against sustainability  commitments in their investment and lending criteria. To  address these expectations and risks, we have adopted a  multi-pronged approach. We had also earlier undertaken  formal reviews of our physical and transitional risks under  different climate scenarios, including assessment of  financial impact arising from the material risks. We have assessed our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions footprint  across our entire value chain and refreshed our SBTi  reduction targets, and brought forward our net-zero  target from 2050 to 2045, as part of our commitment  to environmental stewardship. Singtel is the only Asian  telco with a net-zero target ahead of 2050 and is the first  telecoms company in Asia to renew its SBTi targets. As   part of its renewed targets with 2023 as the base year,  Singtel is aiming for a group-wide 55% reduction in scope  1 and 2 direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, and  a 40% reduction in scope 3 third-party emissions by 2030.  These targets also align our 2030 carbon contribution   and reduction target with the agreements originally   made at Paris COP (Conference of the Parties) 21 and  updated at subsequent Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change reports and COP events. To support  the achievement of our targets, we will set up a supplier  engagement programme to help our suppliers understand  their emissions better, set reduction targets and work  towards them.  To achieve our scope 1 and 2 targets, we are focusing  on the electrification of our fleet of vehicles, improving  our energy efficiency, acquiring renewable energy  including renewable energy certificates, power purchase  agreements, and offering lower carbon products to our  customers. We have implemented internal carbon pricing  to ensure the business prices in carbon for decision  making. We are progressively adapting our infrastructure  design and standards to long-term scenarios related  to climate change. We have also supported a global  agreement for the ICT industry through our active  participation at the GSM Association to align the efforts   of this sector and will progressively extend our climate   and emission reduction efforts into our supply chain to  address our scope 3 emissions. We published our first  standalone Group TCFD Report in FY2022 with annual  updates. We are preparing for our FY2026 reporting  year in compliance with the requirements of the IFRS S2  Climate-related Disclosures. Risk Management Philosophy and Approach 90  ===== PAGE 93 ===== We have enhanced Board-level governance with a Risk and  Sustainability Committee to ensure closer board oversight  of all material ESG issues including climate-related risks  and continue to educate the business on climate and  emissions so that the issues and opportunities can be  tackled across all parts of the business. Ventures, Mergers, Acquisitions   and Partnerships Our future growth largely depends on our ability to develop  our new growth engines, which involves substantial ventures,  mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships activity. This comes  with considerable risks. Joint Venture Digital Banking Risks The Group is part of various consortiums that are licensed  to operate digital banks – GXS in Singapore, GXBank in  Malaysia, and Superbank in Indonesia. These joint ventures  offer the Group an opportunity to serve a vast unbanked  and underbanked population. However, they require  substantial capital outlay and could suffer investment  losses, arising from failure to scale and acquire customers,  or the failure to manage the various risk exposures related  to the digital banking business. We also face regulatory  risks associated with the banking industry, including  compliance with existing, or new laws and regulations,  and associated increased costs of compliance. The digital  banks may not be able to attract, integrate, and retain the  right talent with the appropriate skillsets and expertise to  develop and execute the bank’s business strategies and  plans, or effectively manage risks arising from the bank’s  activities. Licence to continue operations may be lost if an  individual digital bank’s financial performance does not  meet expectations or deteriorates. There could also be  misalignment of interests, goals, and cultures between the  members of the consortium, and/or with the management  of the digital bank, resulting in an inability to resolve  disputes in an effective and timely manner. We have shareholders’ agreements in place to ensure  governance and rights protection. Respective boards   have been established to provide oversight of the  respective operational risks and to ensure good  governance and compliance.  Merger & Acquisition Risks  We continually look for investment opportunities that  align with the Group’s strategy. We adopt a disciplined  due diligence approach in our pre- and post-acquisition  phases, particularly during the investment evaluation  and decision-making process. We also monitor these  endeavours to ensure that the investments made meet   our strategic objectives and desired returns. Members of  our management team are also directors on the boards of  our associates and joint ventures. Our efforts are challenged by the availability of  opportunities, competition from other potential investors,  foreign ownership restrictions, government and regulatory  policies, political considerations, and the specific  preferences of sellers. We face risks arising from financing  and integrating newly acquired businesses, whereby they  become a drain on our resources; inability to generate  synergies; and limited experience and/or resources in  managing these acquired businesses and talent. Also, the  business strategies of some of our regional associates  may involve expanding operations outside their home  countries, as well as in-country mergers and acquisitions.  They may enter joint ventures and other arrangements  with other parties. These also pose risks with no guarantee  of success. The objectives of these joint ventures and   other arrangements may be inconsistent with those of   the associates. The integration of NCS’ Australian entities has progressed  well with the approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment  Review Board (FIRB) to undertake internal corporate  moves to consolidate under NCS Australia, facilitating  development of a common operating entity and go  to market with a single identity. We believe that the  Asia Pacific market continues to offer the best growth  opportunities for technology services globally and remain  fully committed to growing in the region.  Partnership Risks  To a large extent, the success of our strategic investments  depends on our relationships with, and the strength of,  our partners. There is no guarantee that we will be able  to maintain these relationships, or that our partners will  remain committed to the partnerships. 91 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 94 ===== Sustainability Realising our sustainability-related goals while ensuring that our business  remains resilient and sustainable has always been a top priority for  Singtel. Guided by our Group purpose to Empower Every Generation, we  have focused on the four pillars of our sustainability framework – Climate  Change and Environment, People and Future of Work, Community Impact and  Sustainable Value Creation to drive positive change.  As a leading communications technology company, we are committed   to empowering people and businesses and creating a more sustainable  future for all. That is why we brought forward our net-zero target to 2045 and  launched a new 4D strategy (Defend, Decarbonise, Dematerialise and Deliver)  to help us achieve our ambitions.  We have also stepped up measures to build a more diverse and inclusive  workplace where our people grow and flourish through a slew of programmes  including new career mobility platforms, employee mentorship and networking  initiatives as well as wellness services.  At the community level, we have also been strengthening our digital  empowerment activities so we can uplift all segments of society as we advance  towards a digital economy.  The following sections present selected highlights of our progress across   these key sustainability areas. For a comprehensive overview of our strategies,  efforts and outcomes, read the Singtel Group Sustainability Report 2024.

The COP28’s evaluation of global   efforts to address climate change  highlighted the dire need for greater  action to achieve the goals set out in   the Paris Agreement. As a technology leader, it is incumbent  on us to be prudent in the business  choices we make, so we can leave a  better planet for future generations.  In that vein, we made the bold move  to refresh our greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions targets, committing to  reductions to our absolute scope 1   and scope 2 targets. These were  validated by the Science Based Targets  initiative (SBTi). We also moved our net-zero target from  2050 to 2045 – the only Asian telco to  do so, reflecting our commitment to  this cause. To ensure we are delivering  against these goals, we launched a  new 4D strategy (Defend, Decarbonise,  Dematerialise and Deliver) that  captures our decarbonisation and  electrification efforts, among others.  Defend  our assets by mitigating   climate-related risks through  better network design To ensure minimal disruption to our  operations from the physical effects of  climate-related disasters, we are future- proofing our assets and enhancing our  network resilience.  In Singapore, Nxera has begun  construction on its most advanced   and efficient 58MW data centre,  DC Tuas, which is expected to be  operational in 2026. Through the   use of innovative liquid-cooling  technologies, DC Tuas will feature   one of the industry’s most efficient  power usage effectiveness of about   1.23 at full load.    In Australia, Optus has invested  approximately A$8.8 million into a range of  government funded adaptation initiatives  in its network. Optus has more than  8,000 sites including exchanges, satellite  operation centres and other infrastructure  nationally. This includes investments in  generators with larger battery capacities   to power satellite cells and trailers that   can be deployed at disaster sites quickly. 7% reduction in scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions 33% reduction in scope 3 emissions 93 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 96 ===== Sustainability Decarbonise our operations through   climate action By installing 1.26MWp of solar  photovoltaic systems across 10 facilities  and surrendering 71,000 Energy Attribute  Certificates in both Singapore and  Australia, we have increased our use of  energy backed by renewable sources  to 9.3%. Consequently, our total GHG  emissions were 2,962,121tCO2e, 30.8%  lower compared to 4,227,369tCO2e  last year. Our scope 1 and 2 absolute  GHG emissions were 7.1% lower at  409,120tCO2e and our scope 3 emissions  fell by 33.5% to 2,553,001tCO2e. In collaboration with Ericsson, we  have been deploying energy-efficient  equipment and technologies, like their  latest radio cells, at our mobile base  stations, resulting in energy savings   and lower operating expenses. Since July 2023, we have required   our business units to incorporate   an internal carbon fee into any   emissions-intensive capital and  operating expenditure exceeding  100 tonnes of carbon over its lifecycle.  This is aimed at encouraging the  selection of lower emission options.   To date, this carbon fee framework   has been applied to 29 tenders  including the purchase of servers  and logistics. To further encourage  the selection of eco-friendly options,  the Singtel Group has established a  green fund to support investments  within the business that improve our  environmental performance.  About S$14 million in drawdowns have  been approved so far to support the  additional upfront costs of 12 business  cases. This includes switching our  vehicles from diesel to electric in  Singapore and the installation of solar  panels in Australia. Dematerialise  our business through  promoting circularity The public and private sectors are  increasingly embracing the benefits   of circularity which is a highly  effective approach to reducing  material consumption and  GHG emissions. we have been  encouraging circularity via public  engagement campaigns, including  partnering with e-waste collection  service providers and setting up  easy-access avenues for customers  to return their devices. To facilitate  more e-waste collection, we added  pop-up booths at product launch  events, allowing customers to trade- in their old devices for cash.  These schemes not only reduce the  environmental impact associated   with new electronic device  production but also promote  sustainable consumption habits  among customers. As a founding  member of the GSM Association  (GSMA) Device Circularity Working  Group, which works with phone  manufacturers to improve device  circularity, we are committed to  collecting at least 20% of the mobile  devices we distribute to customers,  and to recycle or repair 100% of the  devices collectedby 2030.  Through our strong advocacy for  responsible resource management  and e-waste management, we  collected 60,545kg of e-waste in the  past year. About 113,450 devices were  refurbished or reused while 120,992  devices were recycled.  In Australia, Optus launched the   Ultra WiFi6 modem which has a  casing constructed with at least 95%  recycled plastic and comes without  any single-use plastic packaging.    Deliver sustainable value to   our stakeholders Education is key to raising greater  awareness and action on climate  change. To ensure our employees  continue to be well-informed and  proficient on topics like carbon  management, e-waste and SBTi,   we ran targeted training sessions  throughout the year.  Having embarked on our sustainability  journey decades ago, we wanted to  share our learnings and best practices  with the industry to encourage  collective action and collaboration.   We successfully organised our  inaugural Singtel Environmental  Sustainability Day which was attended  by over 400 people including our   Board members, partners, customers,  analysts and investors.  As part of a Singapore Business  Federation-led consortium, Singtel,  together with PwC and several related  government agencies, will support   the set-up of a Singapore Emission   Factors Registry by end-2024. The  Registry, which will consist of a  database of emission factors tailored  to Singapore’s context, will help local  businesses track and report their  emissions more accurately. We also co-authored A Supplier’s  Guidebook to Sustainability for   small and medium enterprises in  Singapore. This is a nationwide  initiative by the National Sustainable  Procurement Roundtable to promote  sustainable procurement.  For these efforts, Singtel received  the highest 'A' score on the CDP   Climate Change List and maintained  an 'A' leadership score in the CDP  Supplier Engagement rating for 2023. 94  ===== PAGE 97 ===== People and Future of Work  Helping our people to   stay engaged, resilient   and future-ready Our people are our greatest strength  and the key to the Group’s sustainable  growth and success.  We foster a dynamic and rewarding  workplace through our distinctive  BIG culture, ensuring every employee   feels a strong sense of Belonging,   can make a meaningful Impact, and  have continuous opportunities for  Growth. This commitment is reflected   in a 6% year-on-year increase in our  employee engagement score to 75%,  which places us in the global top  quartile of engaged organisations (1). Advancing diversity, equity,  inclusion and belonging The Singtel Group champions Diversity,  Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB)  principles and practices. Our workforce  spans four generations, with employees  from 100 different nationalities. Today, women account for 33% of our  workforce and 31% are in management.  Female representation in the Singtel  Board of Directors and Group  Management Committee is industry- leading at 46% and 30% respectively.  Six women tech leaders from Singtel  and NCS were named in the 2023  Singapore 100 Women in Tech list.  Today, we have 11 employee networks  that nurture belonging and facilitate  networking and peer support among  colleagues with shared interests and  identities. These include three new  networks established in 2024: Early  Professionals Group, the RISE women’s  support group and the Express Yourself  group which encourages employees to  celebrate their individuality. We are committed to building a more  equitable workplace. In Singapore,  we abide by the Tripartite Guidelines  on Fair Employment Practices  outlined by the Tripartite Alliance for  Fair and Progressive Employment  Practices. Effective January 2024,  we have expanded the scope of  union representation to managerial  job grade employees under limited  representation on an individual basis,  in collaboration with the Union of  Telecoms Employees of Singapore.  In Australia, Optus’ employment  frameworks are built on principles  that uphold fair treatment and  Note: (1)	 Kincentric Global Benchmark equal opportunity for all employees,  as outlined in the Fair Work Act  2009 and state/territory anti- discrimination laws. Optus welcomed  the Workplace Gender Equality  Amendment (Closing the Gender  Pay Gap) Bill 2023 as a significant  step in reducing the gender pay gap.  The Optus Retail Agreement was  launched in July 2023 to enhance  workplace culture and support for  retail staff.  Enhancing employee  well-being, strengthening  workplace safety and health The well-being of our employees is  a top priority, and we offer holistic   well-being programmes to support  them mentally, physically, financially,  socially and professionally. For  example, we launched a new  enhanced healthcare and medical  benefits programme which provides  employees and their dependants  with greater coverage and flexibility  to meet their needs. We partnered  mental healthcare company,  Intellect, to provide a suite of mental  health services for Singtel and NCS  employees and their dependants. 33% of our workforce   are women S$20m investment in staff  training 95 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 98 ===== Sustainability Community Impact  Attracting and   developing talent We continue to invest in upskilling and  reskilling our employees to ensure   that our workforce continues to thrive  amid technological and industry  changes. Our people development  framework is built on the ACT  principles: Accelerate, Co-create, and  Transform. To facilitate ACT for people  development, our four corporate  learning academies: Singtel 8George,  NCS Dojo, Optus U and Data Centre  Academy, offer a comprehensive  range of programmes anchored on  the four pillars of Personal Excellence,  Tech Acceleration, Leadership  Excellence and Future Readiness. The Singtel Group actively recruits  young talent from diverse institutions  across Singapore, Australia  and beyond. In Singapore, the  Management Associate Programme  develops future leaders, and  welcomed 56 new participants in  2023. The NCS Nucleus programme  and work-study programmes like  Catalyst and NCS Fusion which offer  degree opportunities alongside  full-time employment, attracted 518  participants in 2023. The NCS Ignite  programme caters to ITE graduates  pursuing tech careers, and welcomed  43 participants. In Australia, the Optus  Tech Talent Incubator programme   has successfully onboarded over   100 graduates in the last two years.  As a leading communications  technology group, we are committed  to empowering marginalised  communities so they can thrive in   a digital era. We recognise that technology can  play a critical role in the development  of innovative solutions that can help  the social and environmental sectors.  Through the Singtel Group Future  Digital inclusion  In FY2024, Optus’ Donate Your Data  initiative in Australia provided over   15 million GB of data to 6,335 individuals  who would otherwise not have access to   the internet. The initiative was further  enhanced to provide training to  beneficiaries in cyber security basics, online  scam identification and safe internet use,  supported by Optus’ Specialist Care Team. Optus also invests in early career  partnerships, including 42   Adelaide, to support diverse talent  in software engineering. During the year, we revamped our  HR policies and practices to make it  easier for employees to explore   new internal career opportunities   to further their growth. These  changes resulted in a 25% increase  in internal applicants for open  positions. We also launched the   BIG Marketplace, a Group-wide  online platform designed to help  employees discover and apply  for internal positions, short-term  projects and volunteer opportunities. >S$57m raised for the Singtel Touching  Lives Fund since 2002 >15m GB  of data provided to 6,335   individuals through Optus’   Donate Your Data initiative Makers (SGFM) programme, which  supports social enterprises that  harness technology to tackle societal  challenges, we have awarded  regional grants to nine alumni  startups that use 5G, AI and IoT to  address issues such as mental health  and waste management. Since 2016,  the SGFM programme has assisted  over 80 startups with more than   S$5 million in grants.  96  ===== PAGE 99 ===== Special needs students having fun with Singtel staff volunteers at the Singtel Carnival 2023. 2,000 students from 18 SPED schools  enjoy a day of fun and activities at the  Singapore Expo.

Equity and supporting   the vulnerable Our corporate philanthropy  programme, the Singtel Touching  Lives Fund (STLF), which is dedicated  to supporting disadvantaged and  special needs children in Singapore,  has raised over S$57 million since  it was launched in 2002. Last year,  we collaborated with the Singapore  University of Social Sciences to study  STLF’s impact on students from the  six beneficiary special education  (SPED) schools that we support. The  published study revealed that 67%  of parents and caregivers found  that the STLF helped SPED students  improve their cognitive skills, gain  self-confidence and improve their  relationship-building capabilities.  Over 60% of the teachers also  expressed their appreciation of  STLF’s programmes, noting its  positive impact.

Sustainable supply   chain management We have an extensive global  supply chain, from mobile phone  manufacturers to network equipment  providers. To advance our sustainable  procurement efforts, we established  a Responsible Procurement  Taskforce, comprising representatives  from Singtel’s Procurement and  Sustainability units. The taskforce  developed a Responsible Procurement  Policy that reflects the Group’s  procurement framework and ethos  of buying better products from better  companies in a better way. The revised  framework also includes responsible  sourcing specifications and guidelines  as well as resources for Singtel business  owners and procurement teams to  reference when engaging vendors and  partners across the supply chain.  In Australia, Optus also introduced  enhanced procurement guidelines  aligned with its social and  environmental goals. We have also embarked on the  CDP Supply Chain Programme to  encourage our suppliers to disclose  their emissions, enabling us to better  understand their emissions profiles and  identify areas for improvement.  Customer safety   and privacy All enterprises, big and small, need to  be equipped to deal with increasingly  complex scams that deploy AI,  phishing, social engineering and   other modes of deception to trick  consumers into giving away their  critical personal data.  To help large enterprises, especially  financial institutions that are frequent  targets of scammers, the Singtel  Cyber Security Institute collaborated  with the SIM Academy to develop  a cyber scam preparedness  programme that is designed to help  frontline staff be better prepared to  deal with sophisticated scams.  Similarly, to help our small and  medium enterprise (SME) customers  strengthen their security posture,  we launched the Cyber Elevate  Programme in September 2023  in partnership with SkillsFuture  Singapore. The affordably priced  first-of-its-kind training and cyber  incident management programme  focuses on improving the cyber  resilience of SMEs through workshops  that teach them how to identify and  respond to cyber incidents.

Airtel reported strong revenue and  EBITDA growth in both India and Africa in constant currency  terms. However, growth was moderated by currency  devaluations in Africa, especially the Nigerian Naira.  Including higher interest income from capital recycling,  underlying net profit grew 10% to S$2.26 billion. With net  exceptional losses mainly from non-cash impairment charges  and fair value losses in Africa, as compared to net exceptional  gains last year, net profit declined 64% to S$795 million.   Five-year Financial Review  FY2023 The Group’s businesses saw a healthy recovery, capitalising  on the reopening of economies and the resumption of  international travel amid currency headwinds. With a 6%  depreciation in the Australian Dollar, operating revenue   and EBITDA declined 4.7% and 2.2% to S$14.62 billion and  S$3.69 billion respectively. Excluding adverse currency   effects and the absence of revenue from NBN migration   and Amobee which has been sold, operating revenue rose  5.1% from mobile and ICT services growth. With higher  operating revenue and cost savings, EBITDA was up 2.8%.  The associates’ post-tax contributions grew 6.1% to   S$1.62 billion and would have increased 12% in constant  currency terms on the back of sustained growth momentum  at Airtel, which was partly offset by lower contribution from  Telkomsel as it faced pressure from declining legacy services.  Consequently, underlying net profit grew 6.8% to S$2.05  billion. Net exceptional gains included a gain on disposal of  a 3.3% direct stake in Airtel which partially offset a non-cash  impairment charge on Optus’ goodwill. Including higher net  exceptional gains, net profit grew 14% to S$2.23 billion.  101 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 104 ===== Group Five-year Financial Summary FY2022 The Group delivered resilient earnings despite challenges  from the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertain macro  environment. Operating revenue was S$15.34 billion, 1.9%  lower than FY2021, reflecting declines in equipment sales,  prepaid mobile, as well as lower NBN migration revenue in  Australia. Excluding NBN migration revenue and Jobs Support  Scheme credits, operating revenue was stable while EBITDA  rose 8.1%, driven by strong mobile service growth in Australia. The associates’ post-tax contributions grew 19%. This was  lifted by Airtel’s robust turnaround with its sturdy recovery  in India and sustained growth in Africa, but partly offset  by profit decline in AIS due to higher depreciation and 5G  spectrum amortisation charges.  Underlying net profit grew 11% to S$1.92 billion. Including net  exceptional gains of S$25 million mainly from the Group’s  divestment of its 70% equity stake in Australia Tower Network  Pty Ltd compared to net exceptional loss last year, net profit  grew two and a half times to S$1.95 billion.  FY2021 The Group’s results were adversely impacted by  unprecedented headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic  and ongoing structural challenges in the industry. Operating  revenue dipped 5.4% to S$15.64 billion driven by declines  in mobile roaming, prepaid, equipment sales and digital  advertising, as well as lower NBN migration revenue in  Australia. However, ICT revenue rose strongly led by NCS, as  enterprises rushed to digitalise and transform their businesses.  EBITDA was down 16% to S$3.83 billion due to the decline in  revenue, and lower retail fixed margins in Australia.  The associates’ post-tax contribution was stable as a strong  recovery in Airtel offset profit declines from Telkomsel, AIS   and Globe which were impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns.  Consequently, underlying net profit fell 30% to S$1.73 billion.  Including net exceptional charges of S$1.18 billion mainly   from non-cash impairment charges on the carrying values   of Amobee and Trustwave, as well as network assets, net   profit declined 49% to S$554 million.  FY2020 This was a challenging year, given structural shifts in the  industry, soft economic conditions, adverse regulatory  outcomes in India and the onset of COVID-19 in the fourth  quarter.  With a 6% depreciation in the Australian Dollar,  operating revenue declined 4.8% to S$16.54 billion and EBITDA  fell 3.2% to S$4.54 billion. In constant currency terms, operating  revenue dipped 2.0%, mainly from lower mobile service  revenue and equipment sales while EBITDA remained stable  with a reduction in operating lease expenses under the new  lease accounting standard. EBIT (before associates) declined  19% after including depreciation of right-of-use assets. Underlying net profit fell 13% to S$2.46 billion, with increased  net losses at Airtel and weakness at Australia Consumer as a  result of continuing data price competition, lower equipment  sales and margins, and low NBN resale margins. Net profit declined 65% to S$1.08 billion due to net  exceptional losses of S$1.38 billion mainly arising from the  Group’s share of Airtel’s exceptional charges for regulatory  costs, including the adjusted gross revenue matter and a  one-time spectrum charge. 102  ===== PAGE 105 ===== Group Financial Year ended 31 March 2024 S$ million 2023 S$ million Change % Change in  constant currency (1) % Operating revenue 14,128  14,624  -3.4 -0.2   EBITDA 3,597  3,686  -2.4 0.6 EBITDA margin 25.5% 25.2%   Share of associates' pre-tax profits (2) 2,338  2,287  2.2 6.3 EBIT 3,491  3,399  2.7 5.8 EBIT (before associates' contributions) (2) 1,153  1,112  3.7 4.8 Underlying net profit (3)  2,261  2,053  10.1 13.1 Underlying earnings per share (S cents) (3) 13.7  12.4  10.1 13.1 Exceptional items (post-tax) (4) (1,466) 172  nm nm   Net profit 795  2,225  -64.3 -62.7 Basic earnings per share (S cents) 4.8  13.5  -64.2 -62.7   Share of associates' post-tax profits (2) 1,681  1,619  3.9 7.8 Excluding contributions from Trustwave (5) Operating revenue 14,051 14,461 -2.8 0.4   EBITDA 3,645 3,802 -4.1 -1.1   EBIT (before associates' contributions) (2) 1,209 1,245 -2.9 -1.8 “Associate” refers to an associate and/or a joint venture as defined under SFRS(I).  “nm” denotes not meaningful.

Management Discussion and Analysis 103 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 106 ===== Management Discussion and Analysis The Group delivered resilient results for the full financial year  amid macroeconomic, inflationary and foreign currency  pressures. The Group’s underlying net profit for FY2024  was up 10% to S$2.26 billion, reflecting increased regional  associate contributions and higher interest income from  capital recycling. In constant currency terms, underlying   net profit would have risen 13%.  The Group’s operating revenue and EBITDA were down  3.4% and 2.4% respectively on the back of a 6% depreciation  of the Australian Dollar. However, EBIT (1) was up 3.7% from  lower depreciation and amortisation charges. On a constant  currency basis, operating revenue and EBITDA would have  been stable as the mobile business in Singapore and Australia  saw positive momentum while declines in enterprise services  were offset by NCS’ growth, while EBIT  (1) would have risen  4.8%. The associates’ post-tax profit contributions grew 3.9% and  in constant currency terms, their contributions would have  increased 7.8% with growth in India and Thailand. Airtel  reported strong growth in operating revenue and EBITDA in  both India and Africa in constant currency terms. This was  moderated by currency devaluations in Africa, especially  the Nigerian Naira. Telkomsel’s net profit was boosted  by contributions from its IndiHome broadband business,  which was integrated from 1 July 2023, and growth in data  and digital services. However, its contribution to the Group  dropped mainly due to a reduction in Singtel’s equity   interest from 1 July 2023 (2). AIS’ robust performance was   driven by growth from mobile and fixed while Globe   delivered healthy mobile revenue growth, partly offset   by higher network-related costs. There were net exceptional losses of S$1.47 billion, mainly  attributable to non-cash impairment charges on the goodwill  of Optus, Asia Pacific Cyber Security Business and NCS  Australia, and on Optus Enterprise’s network assets as well  as share of significant fair value losses at Airtel Africa from a  revaluation of USD liabilities and derivatives due largely to  the devaluation of Nigerian Naira. The losses were partially  mitigated by a non-cash dilution gain from a 5% reduction in  the Group’s effective equity interest in Telkomsel and a gain  recorded from the divestment of the Group’s 0.8% direct stake  in Airtel.  With net exceptional losses as compared to net exceptional  gains last year, the Group’s net profit for FY2024 declined 64%  to S$795 million. The Group has diversified its earnings base through its  expansion and investments in overseas markets. On a  proportionate basis, if the associates are consolidated  line-by-line, operations outside Singapore accounted for  76% (FY2023: 76%) and 83% (FY2023: 82%) of the Group’s  proportionate revenue and EBITDA respectively. The Group’s financial position remains solid. In FY2024, the  Group continued its capital recycling efforts and received  cash from divestments. This mainly comprised S$937 million  from the sale of a partial stake in Airtel, S$282 million from  the sale of a 6.0% stake in Nxera Investment Holdings Pte.  Ltd. (formerly known as ST Dynamo Investment Holdings Pte.  Ltd.) and partial proceeds of S$148 million from the sale of  the Group’s remaining 3.9% stake in Airtel Africa. Net debt  reduced to S$7.8 billion from S$8.3 billion a year ago on higher  cash and cash equivalents (3), boosted by cash inflows from  divestments. Free cash flow for FY2024 declined 1.7% to S$2.57  billion, mainly due to lower dividends from associates.  (1)	 	 Excluding associates’ contributions. (2)	 	 In Singapore Dollar terms, the contributions from IndiHome largely offset the impact from Singtel’s reduced stake.

However, Optus continued to make progress in  executing to its strategy. The growth in mobile service and  Home revenues were moderated by the decline in   the Enterprise fixed business. Mobile service revenue grew  3.8%, backed by robust prepaid customer growth of 108,000  with strong gains by amaysim, and higher postpaid ARPU.  EBITDA and EBIT were stable as pressures from eroding   fixed enterprise margins and higher content and energy   costs were mitigated by cost optimisation efforts.  SINGTEL SINGAPORE   Singtel Singapore’s operating revenue fell 2.4% due to lower  enterprise and legacy carriage especially voice, partially  offset by higher mobile roaming and IoT connectivity. Mobile  service revenue momentum continued with 2.8% growth. This  helped mitigate legacy and ICT declines as Singtel Singapore  works towards creating new revenue streams. With lower  operating revenue, EBITDA declined 2.6%. EBIT was down 5.2%  after including higher depreciation charges from increased  investments in digital, network resiliency and cyber security. NCS  NCS’ operating revenue grew 3.9% (4.5% in constant currency  terms), with balanced growth across all its businesses,  having completed the integration of its Australian businesses  and with Greater China delivering strong double-digit  growth. It has scaled up its global delivery network, with  access to regional talent, resulting in lower cost-to-serve.  EBITDA increased 4.5%, driven by higher operating revenue  and strong cost management. EBIT grew strongly by 31%  due to the positive EBITDA impact and a reduction in  amortisation charges for acquired intangibles. NCS secured  S$3.0 billion of new bookings for the year.  DIGITAL INFRACO Digital InfraCo delivered healthy 8.0% operating revenue  growth, driven by its Nxera data centre business and   satellite services. Nxera’s revenue grew mainly from price  increases and higher utility revenue. Satellite revenue was  up mostly from fees earned from project-based satellite  deployment services. With Nxera continuing to expand its  capabilities and scale up in the region, EBITDA and EBIT  declined 4.1% and 1.2% respectively.  106  ===== PAGE 109 ===== Associates (1) Financial Year ended 31 March 2024 S$ million 2023 S$ million Change % Change in  constant currency  (2) % Group's share of associates' pre-tax profits (3) 2,338  2,287  2.2 6.3 Share of post-tax profits Telkomsel (3) 628  664  -5.5 -1.7 AIS  274  240  13.9 16.3 Intouch (4) - operating results  131  100  30.7 33.5 - amortisation of acquired intangibles (9) (9) 1.1 3.9 121  91  33.7 36.5 Globe (3) 222  232  -4.1 -0.4 Airtel (3) - ordinary results (India and South Asia)  459  345  33.4 39.1 - ordinary results (Africa)  79  116  -32.3 -27.3 538  461  16.8 23.2 - fair value loss from Naira's devaluation (5) 45  -  nm nm 584  461  26.6 32.7 Bharti Telecom Limited (BTL) (144) (76) 90.6 98.1 440  385  14.1 19.8 Regional associates  1,685  1,612  4.5 8.5 Other associates (3)(6) (4) 7  nm nm Group's share of associates' post-tax profits (3) 1,681  1,619  3.9 7.8 “Associate” refers to an associate and/or a joint venture under SFRS(I).  “nm” denotes not meaningful.

The increases were partially offset by  accelerated declines in legacy voice and SMS services. Data  revenue rose due to increases in both customer base and  mobile ARPU. With higher operating revenue, EBITDA was up  7%. Telkomsel’s net profit (4) (excluding fair value adjustments  for GoTo) increased by 10% after including higher depreciation  charges and interest expenses from leases. However, its   post-tax profit contribution to the Group in Singapore Dollar  terms declined 5.5% mainly due to the reduction in Singtel’s  equity interest from 35.0% to 30.1% from 1 July 2023 and a  weaker Indonesian Rupiah. AIS’ service revenue (excluding interconnect and equipment)  rose 8%, boosted by first-time contributions from Triple T  Broadband Public Company Limited (“TTTBB”) and growth  across all services, lifted by an improved economy and  expanded tourist sector. Fixed broadband revenue grew  strongly, benefiting from the integration of TTTBB’s business,  increased service coverage and solid customer demand.  EBITDA improved 10% on service revenue growth, improved  handset margins and effective cost management. After  including higher depreciation from an expanded network  and increased amortisation due to newly acquired 700MHz  spectrum licence, and higher financing costs from increased  borrowings, AIS’ net profit rose 16%. Despite a weaker Thai  Baht, AIS’ post-tax profit contribution was up a strong 14% in  Singapore Dollar terms. Intouch’s post-tax profit contribution was up a robust 34%,  driven by AIS’ stronger performance and a write-back of a  provision for a legal dispute which was no longer required.    Globe’s service revenue grew 3% despite the sale of Electronic  Commerce Payments, Inc. (ECPay), an IT and e-commerce  solutions provider, in September 2023. The higher revenue   was driven by increases in mobile data usage, corporate   data and postpaid fixed broadband which were partially  offset by declines in legacy mobile voice and SMS, as well as  legacy fixed and fixed wireless broadband. EBITDA was up  3% from revenue growth. Globe’s net profit was stable after  including higher depreciation from network expansion and  upgrades, and increased finance charges from borrowings  and tower leases, which were partially mitigated by a higher  share of equity accounted gains from its associate Globe  Fintech Innovations, Inc. In Singapore Dollar terms, Globe’s  post-tax contribution declined 4.1% as the Philippine Peso  depreciated significantly.  Airtel Group, comprising businesses in India, Africa and   Sri Lanka, reported growth in operating revenue, EBITDA   and EBIT of 8%, 10% and 12% respectively, impacted by  currency devaluations in Africa, especially the Nigerian Naira.  Airtel’s mobile revenue in India jumped 12%, led by strong  4G/5G customer additions and increased ARPU. Non-mobile  businesses also delivered strong performances. Airtel   Business  continued to grow from the surge in global and  domestic data revenues while growth in Airtel’s Home  business was propelled by accelerated rollouts. Airtel’s   overall operating revenue and EBITDA from India and  South Asia rose 12% and 16% respectively. Including higher  depreciation and amortisation charges and a higher equity  share of Indus’ profit, the Group’s share of post-tax profit   was up significantly by 33% to S$459 million.  Airtel Africa’s operating revenue and EBITDA fell 5% and 6%  respectively, severely impacted by the translation impact  from devaluations of the Nigerian Naira and Malawi Kwacha.  However, in constant currency terms, operating revenue and  EBITDA both increased strongly by 21%. Voice revenue rose on  the back of network expansion, while data revenue grew from  higher penetration and usage. Revenue from Airtel Money  continued to grow, mainly from growth in its customer base  and higher ARPU as its distribution network expanded. After  including higher depreciation and amortisation charges   from increased mobile network investments, the Group’s   share of Airtel Africa’s post-tax profit declined 32%.  After including BTL’s widening net loss of S$144 million  (FY2023: S$76 million) due to higher finance expenses from   its increased borrowings following its recent acquisition of   an additional stake in Airtel, the post-tax profit contribution  from Airtel Group and BTL rose 14% to S$440 million.

The Group continued to be in a strong financial position   as at 31 March 2024.  Total assets decreased from a year ago due mainly to  non-cash impairment charges recorded during the year.  The decline was partly mitigated by higher cash and cash  equivalents as a result of cash inflows from divestments   (see page 110) and an increase in the carrying value of joint  ventures of the Group, boosted by Tekomsel’s integration   of IndiHome’s fixed broadband business. Total liabilities   grew mainly from a net increase in borrowings.  Currency translation losses widened, reflecting translation  losses due to the strong Singapore Dollar. 111 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 114 ===== Management Discussion and Analysis Capital Management and Dividend Policy Financial Year ended 31 March 2024 2023 Gross debt (S$ million) 12,409 11,483 Net debt (1) (S$ million)  7,782 8,329 Net debt gearing ratio (2) (%) 23.8 24.3 Net debt to EBITDA and share of associates’ pre-tax profits (number of times)  1.31 1.39 Interest cover (3) (number of times) 17.8 16.8 Notes: (1)	 Net debt is defined as gross debt adjusted for related hedging balances less cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprised cash and  bank balances as well as investments in Singapore Treasury bills and fixed deposits.  (2)	 Net debt gearing ratio is defined as the ratio of net debt to net capitalisation. Net capitalisation is the aggregate of net debt, shareholders’ funds and  non-controlling interests. (3)	 Interest cover refers to the ratio of EBITDA and share of associates’ pre-tax profits to net interest expense. As at 31 March 2024, the Group’s net debt was S$7.8 billion,  a decline of S$547 million from a year ago. The decline was  largely due to cash inflows from divestments. Consequently,  net debt gearing ratio fell to 23.8% from 24.3% a year ago.  The Group has one of the strongest credit ratings among  telecommunication companies in the Asia Pacific region and  continues to maintain a healthy capital structure. Singtel is  currently rated A1 by Moody’s and A by S&P Global Ratings. For the financial year ended 31 March 2024, the total ordinary  dividend payout is 15.0 cents per share, a year-on-year  increase of 52%. This comprises an interim dividend of 5.2  cents per share, and subject to shareholders’ approval, a final  dividend of 9.8 cents per share. The final dividend consists of: (a)	 a core dividend of 6.0 cents per share; and (b)	 a value realisation dividend of 3.8 cents per share. The value realisation dividend is to be paid in two tranches of  1.9 cents per share each in August 2024 and December 2024. Singtel is focused on a disciplined capital management  approach of balancing investing for growth and  delivering strong, sustainable total returns to  shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility and  investment-grade credit ratings. This is achieved through  improving business performance and commitment to   an asset recycling programme. Barring unforeseen circumstances, Singtel plans to pay  ordinary dividends comprising: •	 A core dividend at between 70% and 90% of underlying net profit, which will track business performance. •	 A value realisation dividend of 3 - 6 cents per share per annum over the medium term, funded by excess capital generated from asset recycling proceeds after investing in growth initiatives. This policy will be reviewed periodically in line with the  Group’s evolving business strategy and market conditions. 112  ===== PAGE 115 ===== Table of Contents Financial Statements 114 	 Directors’ Statement 125	 Independent Auditors’ Report 131 	 Consolidated Income Statement 132 	 Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 133 	 Statements of Financial Position 135 	 Statements of Changes in Equity 139 	 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 142	 Notes to the Financial Statements Additional Information 233 	 Interested Person Transactions 234 	 Further Information on Board of Directors 238 	 Additional Information on Directors Seeking Re-election 256 	 Further Information on Group Management Committee 260 	 Key Awards and Accolades 263 	 Shareholder Information 265 	 Corporate Information 266 	 Contact Points 113 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information  ===== PAGE 116 ===== Directors' Statement For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 The Directors present their statement to the members together with the audited financial statements of the Company  (“Singtel”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the financial year ended 31 March 2024.

The Audit Committee carried out its functions in accordance with Section 201B of the Companies Act 1967.  In performing its functions, the Committee reviewed the overall scope and results of both internal and external audits  and the assistance given by the Company’s officers to the auditors. It met with the Company’s internal auditors to  discuss the results of the respective examinations and their evaluation of the Company’s system of internal accounting  controls. The Committee also held discussions with the internal and external auditors and is satisfied that the processes  put in place by management provide reasonable assurance on mitigation of fraud risk exposure to the Group. The Committee also reviewed the financial statements of the Company and the Group, as well as the Independent  Auditors’ Report thereon. In the review of the financial statements of the Company and the Group, the Committee had  discussed with management the accounting principles that were applied and their judgement of items that might affect  the integrity of the financial statements.  In addition, the Committee had, with the assistance of the internal auditors, reviewed the procedures set up by the  Company and the Group to identify and report, and where necessary, sought appropriate approval for interested  person transactions. The Committee has full access to and has the co-operation of management and has been given the resources required  for it to discharge its function properly. It also has full discretion to invite any executive officer to attend its meetings. The  external and internal auditors have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee. The Committee has nominated KPMG LLP for re-appointment as auditors of the Company at the forthcoming Annual  General Meeting.  123 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 123  ===== PAGE 126 ===== Directors' Statement For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 7.	 AUDITORS  The auditors, KPMG LLP, have expressed their willingness to accept re-appointment. On behalf of the Directors Lee Theng Kiat	 Yuen Kuan Moon Chairman	 Director Singapore 21 May 2024 124 124  ===== PAGE 127 ===== Independent Auditors’ Report Members of Singapore Telecommunications Limited Report on the audit of the financial statements Opinion We have audited the financial statements of Singapore Telecommunications Limited (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘the  Group’), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and the statement of financial position  of the Company as at 31 March 2024 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive  income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group, and the  statement of changes in equity of the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a  summary of material accounting policies, as set out on pages 131 to 232. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and  statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies  Act 1967 (‘the Act’) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (‘SFRS(I)s’) so as to give a true and fair view  of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2024 and of  the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and the  changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (‘SSAs’). Our responsibilities under those  standards are further described in the ‘Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ section of our report.  We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional  Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (‘ACRA Code’) together with the ethical requirements that  are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in  accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial  statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a  whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 125 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 125  ===== PAGE 128 ===== Independent Auditors’ Report Members of Singapore Telecommunications Limited Revenue recognition The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Group’s Mobile Service, Sale of Equipment and Data  and Internet revenue streams are key audit matters as there  is an elevated inherent risk around the accuracy of amounts  recorded as revenue due to: •	 the complexity of Information Technology (IT)  systems used in billing and the large volume of data  processed; •	 impact of changing pricing models and the  introduction of new products and tariff arrangements;  and •	 different revenue recognition policies for rendering of  services (over time) and sale of goods (point in time).  For the Group’s Operating Revenue stream Infocomm  Technology (“ICT”), there is a significant inherent risk  associated with estimates made by the Group in recognition  and measurement of revenue from certain long-term  contracts. These ICT contract revenue streams are key  audit matters as estimates are required in determining the  budgeted cost and cost to complete to measure the revenue  to be recognised. The accounting policies for revenue recognition, contract  assets and contract liabilities are set out in Notes 2.24, 2.4  and 2.8 to the financial statements respectively and the  various revenue streams for the Group have been disclosed  in Note 4 to the financial statements. Our audit approach included controls testing as well as  substantive procedures. Our procedures included: •	 We obtained an understanding of the nature of the  various revenue streams and the related billing and  revenue recording processes, systems and controls. •	 IT systems: Involving our IT specialists, we tested  the design and implementation, and the operating  effectiveness of automated controls over the capture  of data within IT systems used in billing, interfaces  between relevant IT applications used in billing,  measurement and billing of revenue, and the  recording of revenue recognition entries in the general  ledger. We also tested the access controls and change  management controls over the relevant billing systems. •	 Manual controls: We tested the design and  implementation, and the operating effectiveness of  manual controls over the initiation, authorisation,  recording, and processing of revenue transactions.  This included testing process controls over authorising  new price plans and approval of new product and  tariff changes adjustments to the billing system. •	 We tested, on a sample basis, over time and point in  time revenue transactions recorded throughout the  year. This testing included assessing, the existence of  an underlying arrangement with the customer; the  amounts invoiced to customers in accordance with  the Group’s approved pricing list; and the timing of  revenue recognition for each revenue contract based  on completed performance obligations and the  Group’s revenue recognition policy. •	 For ICT contract revenue, we tested on a sample  basis, the key terms and conditions of the respective  customer contract and evaluated it for appropriate  revenue recognition. We challenged the Group’s  underlying assumptions in making estimates on the  budgeted costs and cost to complete the long-term  contracts. •	 We tested a sample of manual journal entries  impacting  revenue  to  relevant  underlying  documentation for their consistency with the Group’s  accounting policy. Findings For the Group’s Mobile Service, Sale of Equipment and Data and Internet revenue streams, we found the accuracy of amounts  recorded as revenue to be appropriate.  For ICT contract revenue, we found the estimates made in regard to the policies for revenue recognition to be reasonable. 126 126  ===== PAGE 129 ===== Independent Auditors’ Report Members of Singapore Telecommunications Limited Impairment assessment of non-financial assets – Optus Group (“Optus”) cash-generating unit (“CGU”) The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The accounting for the carrying value of Optus CGU has  a material impact on the Group due to the significant  cumulative value of the goodwill and other long-lived non- financial assets. In the current year, the Group recorded an impairment  charge of S$2.0 billion in relation to Optus. At 31 March 2024,  the carrying value of Optus includes S$5.9 billion of goodwill.  Impairment assessment of Optus CGU is a key audit matter  given the elevated and significant inherent risks associated  with the assumptions the Group applied in their Value in Use  (“VIU”) impairment models, including: •	 Forecast future cash flows. The revenue and margins  continue to be impacted by competitive and changing  market conditions offset by the benefit of Optus  entering into the regional Multi-Operator Core  Network (“MOCN”) agreement with TPG Telecom; •	 Forecast future capital expenditure cashflows.  Telecommunications is a capital-intensive business  and changes in technology and market conditions can  impact future capital expenditure requirements; •	 Terminal growth rate. Movements in this rate have an  impact on forecast cashflows; and •	 Discount rate. This is complicated in nature and varies  according to the conditions and environment the CGU  is subject to from time to time.  Refer to Note 26 to the financial statements for the  impairment assessments. Working with our valuation specialists, our procedures  included: •	 Considering the appropriateness of the valuation  method applied by the Group to the CGU to perform  the annual test of goodwill for impairment against the  requirements of the accounting standards.  •	 Agreeing the cash flow forecasts used in the  impairment model to Board approved forecasts and  budgets. •	 Performing risk assessment procedures to determine  the inherent risk of key assumptions and data  that would impact the outcome of the impairment  assessment.  •	 Forecast future cash flows: Considering and  challenging management’s expectations of the future  business developments, comparing against past  performance and corroborating certain revenue  and margin information with market data. We also  considered and challenged the impact of operational  changes to the businesses and the MOCN agreement  on future cash flows. •	 Forecast future capital expenditure: Considering  and challenging management’s assumption on  planned capital expenditure to past expenditure and  corroborating certain assumptions to industry peers. •	 Terminal growth rate: Comparing the terminal growth  rate to published government data and industry peers.  •	 Discount rate: Independently developing a discount  rate range using publicly available market data for  comparable entities, adjusted by risk factors specific to  the CGU, Group and the industry it operates in. •	 Performing a cross-check of the implied value of the  CGU against comparable entities. •	 Recalculating the impairment charge against the  recorded amount. •	 Assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures  in the financial statements in accordance with the  requirements of the accounting standards. Findings We found the key estimates and assumptions used in determining the S$2.0 billion impairment loss recorded to be within a  supportable range.  127 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 127  ===== PAGE 130 ===== Independent Auditors’ Report Members of Singapore Telecommunications Limited Share of joint ventures’ reported contingent liabilities and provision for losses relating to regulatory litigations  The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit A number of the Group’s significant joint ventures have  several on-going disputes and litigations with their local  regulators. The Group may be exposed to significant losses as  a result of the unfavourable outcome of such disputes. This is a key audit matter as significant judgement is required  in assessing the likelihood of the outcome of each matter and  whether the risk of loss is remote, possible or probable and  whether the matter is considered a contingent liability to be  disclosed. Where the risk of loss is probable, management  is required to estimate the provision amount based on the  expected economic outflow resulting from the disputes and  litigations. Please refer to Note 43 to the financial statements for  ‘Significant Contingent Liabilities of Associates and Joint  Ventures’. Our audit procedures included: •	 Inquiring with management of the Group and joint  ventures, and where considered appropriate, internal  legal counsel of the Group and joint ventures to  understand the process and internal controls relating  to the identification and assessment of the disputes  and litigations, and recognition of the related liabilities,  where appropriate. •	 Reviewing the audit working papers of the auditors of  the joint ventures (‘Component Auditors’), in particular,  their assessment on the regulatory litigations and  disputes that may have a material impact to the  financial statements. •	 Discussing with the Component Auditors on their  evaluation of the probability and magnitude of losses  relating to the disputes and litigations, and their  conclusions reached in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-37  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent  Assets. •	 Assessing the appropriateness of disclosures in  the financial statements in accordance with the  requirements of the accounting standards. Findings We found management’s assessment of the regulatory litigations and disputes to be reasonable, and the disclosure of  contingent liabilities to be appropriate.  Other information Management is responsible for the other information contained in the annual report. Other information is defined as all  information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. We have not obtained  any other information prior to the date of this auditors’ report. The other information is expected to be made available to us  after the date of this auditors’ report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance  conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above  when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial  statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we read the other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to  communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs. 128 128  ===== PAGE 131 ===== Independent Auditors’ Report Members of Singapore Telecommunications Limited Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with  the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient  to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and  transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair  financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going  concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless  management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process. Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a  material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of  these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism  throughout the audit. We also: •	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design  and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than  for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the  override of internal controls. •	 Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s  internal controls. •	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related  disclosures made by management. •	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the  audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant  doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we  are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the  date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going  concern. •	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and  whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair  presentation. 129 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 129  ===== PAGE 132 ===== Independent Auditors’ Report Members of Singapore Telecommunications Limited Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (Cont'd) •	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities  within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit. We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding  independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the  audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters  in our auditors’ report unless the law or regulations preclude public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare  circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of  doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary  corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the  provisions of the Act. The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Mr Malcolm Ramsay.

The  address of its registered office is Singapore Post Centre #07-31, 10 Eunos Road 8, Singapore 408600. The principal activities of the Company consist of the operation and provision of telecommunications systems and  services, and investment holding. The principal activities of the significant subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 46. In Singapore, the Group has the rights to provide fixed national and international telecommunications services to  31 March 2037, and public cellular mobile telephone services to 31 March 2032. In addition, the Group is licensed to  offer Internet services and has also obtained frequency spectrum and licence rights to install, operate and maintain  mobile communication systems and services including wireless broadband systems and services. The Group also holds  the requisite licence to provide nationwide subscription television services. In Australia, Optus is granted telecommunication licences under the Telecommunications Act 1991. Pursuant to the  Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1997, the licences continued to have  effect after the deregulation of telecommunications in Australia in 1997. The licences do not have finite terms, but are of  continuing operation until cancelled under the Telecommunications Act 1997. These financial statements were authorised and approved for issue in accordance with a Directors’ resolution dated  21 May 2024. 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 2.1	 Basis of Accounting The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International)  (“SFRS(I)”) including related interpretations, and the provisions of the Companies Act 1967. They have been prepared  under the historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires management to make judgements,  estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions used that are significant to the financial statements, and areas involving  a higher degree of judgement are disclosed in Note 3. The accounting policies have been consistently applied by the Group and are consistent with those used in the  previous financial year. The adoption of the new or revised SFRS(I)s and related interpretations which were mandatory  from 1 April 2023 had no significant impact on the financial statements of the Group or the Company in the current  financial year. 142 142  ===== PAGE 145 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.2	 Foreign Currencies 2.2.1	 Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary  economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The statement of financial position and  statement of changes in equity of the Company and consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in  Singapore Dollar, which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the presentation currency of  the Group. 2.2.2	 Translation of goodwill and fair value adjustments Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign entities completed on or after 1 April 2005  are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entities and are recorded in the functional currencies of the foreign  entities and translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. However, for acquisitions  of foreign entities completed prior to 1 April 2005, goodwill and fair value adjustments continue to be recorded at the  exchange rates at the respective dates of the acquisitions. 2.3	 Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand,  balances with banks and fixed deposits with original maturity of three months or less, net of bank overdrafts which are  repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the Group’s cash management. Bank overdrafts are included  under borrowings in the statement of financial position. 2.4	 Contract Assets Where revenue recognised for a customer contract exceeds the amount received or receivable from a customer, a  contract asset is recognised. Contract assets arise from bundled telecommunications contracts where equipment  delivered at a point in time are bundled with services delivered over time. Contract assets also arise from Infocomm  Technology contracts where performance obligations are delivered over time. Contract assets are transferred to trade  receivables when the considerations for performance obligations are billed. Contract assets are included in ‘Trade and  other receivables’ under current assets as they are expected to be realised in the normal operating cycle. Contract  assets are subject to impairment review for credit risk in accordance with the expected loss model. 2.5	 Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables, including contract assets and receivables from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures,  are initially recognised at fair values and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method,  less an allowance for expected credit loss (“ECL”). The Group applied the ‘simplified approach’ for determining the allowance for ECL for trade receivables and contract  assets, where lifetime ECL are recognised in the income statement at initial recognition of receivables and updated at  each reporting date. Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events  over the expected life of the receivable. When determining the allowance for ECL, the Group considers reasonable  and supportable information that is relevant and available for customer types. This includes both qualitative and  quantitative information based on the Group’s historical experience and forward looking information such as general  economic factors as applicable. Loss events include financial difficulty or bankruptcy of the debtor, significant delay in  payments and breaches of contracts. 143 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 143  ===== PAGE 146 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.5	 Trade and Other Receivables (Cont'd) Trade and other receivables are written off against the allowance for ECL when there is no reasonable expectation of  recovery. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised in the income statement. 2.6	 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted average  basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of  completion and selling expenses. 2.7	 Treasury Bills The Group invests in Singapore Treasury bills. These treasury bills are initially recognised at fair values and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the  effective interest method, less an allowance for ECL. 2.8	 Contract Liabilities Where the amounts received or receivable from customers exceed the revenues recognised for contracts, contract  liabilities or advance billings are recognised in the statement of financial position. Contract liabilities or advance billings  are recognised as revenues when services are provided to customers. 2.9	 Trade and Other Payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the  effective interest method. 2.10	 Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.  After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 2.11	 Associates In the consolidated statement of financial position, investments in associates include goodwill on acquisition identified  on acquisitions completed on or after 1 April 2001, net of accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is assessed for  impairment as part of the investment in associates. Unrealised gains resulting from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the  associate. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no  evidence of impairment. If the share of the unrealised gain exceeds its interest in the associate, the unrealised gain is presented net of the  Group’s carrying amount of the associate. 144 144  ===== PAGE 147 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.12	 Joint Ventures In the consolidated statement of financial position, investments in joint ventures include goodwill on acquisition  identified on acquisitions completed on or after 1 April 2001, net of accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is  assessed for impairment as part of the investment in joint ventures. 2.13	 Business Combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method on and after 1 April 2010. The consideration for  each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred and equity interests  issued by the Group and any contingent consideration arrangement at acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs, other  than those associated with the issue of debt or equity, are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration  is classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent  changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the consolidated income statement. For business combinations that are achieved in stages, any existing equity interests in the acquiree entity are  re-measured to their fair values at acquisition date and any changes are taken to the consolidated income statement. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries represent the equity in subsidiaries which are not attributable, directly  or indirectly, to the shareholders of the Company, and are presented separately in the consolidated statement of  comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and within equity in the consolidated statement  of financial position. The Group elects for each individual business combination whether non-controlling interests in the  acquiree entity are recognised at fair value, or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of  the acquiree entity’s identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests based on their respective interests in a subsidiary,  even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a debit balance. Changes in the Group’s interest in subsidiaries that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as  equity transactions. When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, any interest retained in the former subsidiary is recorded at fair value with  the re-measurement gain or loss recognised in the consolidated income statement. 2.14	 Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (“FVOCI”) Investments On initial recognition, the Group has made an irrevocable election to designate all equity investments (other than  investments in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures) as FVOCI investments as these are strategic investments held  for the long term. They are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent  changes in fair value and translation differences recognised in ‘Other Comprehensive Income’ and accumulated within  ‘Fair Value Reserve’ in equity. Upon disposal, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is transferred to retained earnings  and is not reclassified to the income statement. Dividends are recognised in the income statement when the Group’s  right to receive payments is established. Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to  purchase or sell the investment. 145 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 145  ===== PAGE 148 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.15	 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities 2.15.1	The Group enters into the following derivative financial instruments to hedge its risks, namely - Cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for interest rate risk and cash flow hedges for  currency risk arising from the Group’s issued bonds. The swaps involve the exchange of principal and floating  or fixed interest receipts in the foreign currency in which the issued bonds are denominated, for principal and  floating or fixed interest payments in the entities’ functional currencies. Forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges for the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange  risks arising from forecasted or committed expenditure. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into  and are subsequently re-measured at their fair values at the end of each reporting period. A derivative financial instrument is carried as an asset when the fair value is positive and as a liability when the fair  value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless they  qualify for hedge accounting. 2.15.2	Hedge accounting At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and  the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  At inception and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting  the changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. To be effective, the hedging  relationships are to meet all of the following requirements: (i)	 there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; (ii)	 the effect of credit risk does not dominate the fair value changes that result from that economic relationship; and (iii)	 the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item  that the Group hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group uses to hedge that quantity of  the hedged item. If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk  management objective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio  of the hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again. The Group designates the full change in the fair value of a forward currency contract (i.e. including the forwards  elements) as the hedged risk for all its hedging relationships involving forward currency contracts. 146 146  ===== PAGE 149 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.15.2	Hedge accounting (Cont'd) Fair value hedge Designated derivative financial instruments that qualify for fair value hedge accounting are initially recognised at fair  value on the date that the contract is entered into. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded in the income  statement together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged items that are attributable to the hedged risks. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer  qualifies for hedge accounting. The adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk  is amortised in the income statement from that date. Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the designated derivative financial instruments that qualify as cash  flow hedges are recognised in ‘Other Comprehensive Income’. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is  recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in the ‘Hedging Reserve’ within equity are  transferred to the income statement in the periods when the hedged items affect the income statement. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial  liability, the gain or loss previously recognised in ‘Other Comprehensive Income’ and accumulated in equity are  removed from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial  liability. This transfer does not affect ‘Other Comprehensive Income’. Furthermore, if the Group expects some or all the  loss accumulated in ‘Other Comprehensive Income’ will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately  reclassified to the income statement. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer  qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is  transferred to the income statement when the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a  forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised  immediately in the income statement. Hedges directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform A fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally to replace some of the interbank  offered rates (“IBORs”) with alternative risk-free rates. In Singapore, the Group has exposure to IBORs for its derivatives.  The Group’s main IBOR exposure was indexed to Swap Offered Rate (“SOR”), which had ceased after 30 June 2023  with the use of Singapore Overnight Rate Average (“SORA”) as the alternative interest rate benchmark. The Group has  adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. 2020 IBOR Fallback Protocol whereby Fallback  Rate (SOR) or MAS Recommended Rate after 31 December 2024 will apply for the affected SOR-based derivatives. As at 31 March 2024, the notional amount of swaps benchmarked to Fallback SOR maturing in 2026 to 2031 amounted  to S$2.45 billion (31 March 2023: S$2.45 billion) and the notional amount of swaps benchmarked to SORA maturing in  2026 to 2031 amounted to S$1.81 billion (31 March 2023: S$1.31 billion). 147 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 147  ===== PAGE 150 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.16	 Fair Value Estimation of Financial Instruments Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or  estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into  account the characteristics of the asset or liability which market participants would take into account when pricing the  asset or liability at the measurement date. The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument – Bank balances, Singapore Treasury bills, receivables and payables, current borrowings The carrying amounts approximate fair values due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. Quoted and unquoted investments The fair values of investments traded in active markets are based on the market quoted price or the price quoted by the  market maker at the close of business at the end of the reporting period. The fair values of unquoted investments are determined primarily using latest arm’s length transactions. Cross currency and interest rate swaps The fair value of a cross currency or an interest rate swap is the estimated amount that the swap contract can be  exchanged for or settled with under normal market conditions. This fair value can be estimated using the discounted  cash flow method where the future cash flows of the swap contract are discounted at the prevailing market foreign  exchange rates and interest rates. Market interest rates are actively quoted interest rates or interest rates computed by  applying techniques to these actively quoted interest rates. Forward foreign currency contracts The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates for contracts  with similar maturity profiles at the end of the reporting period. Non-current borrowings For disclosure purposes, the fair values of non-current borrowings which are traded in active markets are based on the  quoted market ask price. For other non-current borrowings, the fair values are based on valuations provided by service  providers or estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using discount rates based on the borrowing  rates which the Group expects would be available at the end of the reporting period. 2.17	 Financial Guarantee Contracts Financial guarantees issued by the Company prior to 1 April 2010 are recorded initially at fair values plus transaction  costs and amortised in the income statement over the period of the guarantee. Financial guarantees issued by the  Company on or after 1 April 2010 are directly charged to the subsidiary as guarantee fees based on fair values. 148 148  ===== PAGE 151 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.18	 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses,  where applicable. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of material, direct labour, capitalised borrowing  costs and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of the property, plant and equipment, less its  residual value, over its expected useful life. The estimated useful lives are as follows – No. of years Buildings 5 - 48 Transmission plant and equipment 2 - 25 Switching equipment 2 - 15 Other plant and equipment 2 - 25 Other plant and equipment consist mainly of motor vehicles, office equipment, and furniture and fittings. No depreciation is provided on freehold land and capital work-in-progress. In respect of capital work-in-progress, assets are depreciated from the month the asset is completed and ready for use. 2.19	 Intangible Assets 2.19.1	Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries on and after 1 April 2010 represents the excess of the consideration transferred,  the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree entity and the fair value of any previous equity  interest in the acquiree entity over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, including contingent liabilities,  at the acquisition date. Such goodwill is recognised separately as intangible asset and stated at cost less accumulated  impairment losses. Acquisitions completed prior to 1 April 2001 Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures completed prior to 1 April 2001 had been  adjusted in full against ‘Other Reserves’ within equity. Such goodwill has not been retrospectively capitalised  and amortised. The Group also had acquisitions where the costs of acquisition were less than the fair value of identifiable net assets  acquired. Such differences (negative goodwill) were adjusted against ‘Other Reserves’ in the year of acquisition. Goodwill which has been previously taken to ‘Other Reserves’, is not taken to the consolidated income statement when  the entity is disposed of or when the goodwill is impaired. 149 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 149  ===== PAGE 152 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.19.1	Goodwill (Cont'd) Acquisitions completed on or after 1 April 2001 Prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures completed on or after  1 April 2001 was capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis in the consolidated income statement over its  estimated useful life of up to 20 years. In addition, goodwill was assessed for indications of impairment at the end of  each reporting period. Since 1 April 2004, goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment or whenever there is an  indication of impairment. The accumulated amortisation for goodwill as at 1 April 2004 had been eliminated with a  corresponding decrease in the capitalised goodwill. When there is negative goodwill, a bargain purchase gain is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement. Gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures include the carrying amount of capitalised  goodwill relating to the entity sold. 2.19.2	Other intangible assets Expenditure on telecommunication and spectrum licences are capitalised and amortised using the straight-line method  over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 20 years. Other intangible assets which are acquired in business combinations are carried at fair values at the date of acquisition,  and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefits. Customer relationships or customer  contracts, brand, and technology have estimated useful lives of 2 to 12 years. Other intangible assets are stated at cost  less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 2.20	 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is subject to an annual impairment test or is more frequently tested for  impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Goodwill is not amortised. Other intangible assets of the Group, which have finite useful lives and are subject to amortisation, as well as property,  plant and equipment and investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, are reviewed at the end of  each reporting period to determine whether there is any indicator for impairment, or whenever events or changes  in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the assets’  recoverable amounts are estimated. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately  identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.  The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use. An impairment loss for an asset, other than goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries, is reversed if, and only if, there has  been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was  recognised. Impairment loss on goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is not reversed. 150 150  ===== PAGE 153 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.21	 Non-current Assets (or Disposal Groups) Held For Sale Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of their carrying  amounts and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amounts are recovered principally through sale transactions  rather than through continuing use. 2.22	 Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new equity shares are  taken to equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. When the Company purchases its own equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable  costs, is recognised as ‘Treasury Shares’ within equity. When the shares are subsequently disposed, the realised gains or  losses on disposal of the treasury shares are included in ‘Other Reserves’ of the Company. 2.23	 Perpetual Securities The perpetual securities issued by the Group do not have a maturity date and the Group may elect to defer making a  distribution, subject to the terms and conditions of the securities issue. Accordingly, the Group is not considered to have  a contractual obligation to make principal repayments or distributions in respect of its perpetual securities issue and the  perpetual securities are classified and presented as equity. Distributions are treated as dividends which will be directly debited from equity. Incremental costs directly attributable  to the issuance of perpetual securities are deducted against the proceeds from the issue. 2.24	 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good  or service to the customer. It is measured based on the amount of the transaction price allocated to the satisfied  performance obligation, and are net of goods and services tax, rebates, discounts and sales within the Group. Revenue from service contracts are recognised ratably over the contract periods as control over the services passes  to the customers as services are provided. Service revenue is also recognised based on usage (e.g. minutes of traffic/  bytes of data). For prepaid cards which have been sold, revenue is recognised based on usage. A contract liability is recognised for  advance payments received from customers where services have not been rendered as at the end of the reporting  period. Expenses directly attributable to the unearned revenue are deferred until the revenue is recognised. Revenue from the sale of equipment (e.g. handsets and accessories) is recognised upon the transfer of control to the  customer or third party dealer which generally coincides with delivery and acceptance of the equipment sold. Goods and services deliverable under bundled telecommunication contracts are identified as separate performance  obligations to the extent that the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own. The transaction price  is allocated between goods and services based on their relative standalone selling prices. Standalone selling prices are  determined by assessing prices paid for standalone equipment and for service-only contracts. Where standalone selling  prices are not directly observable, estimation techniques are used. 151 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 151  ===== PAGE 154 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.24	 Revenue Recognition (Cont'd) Contracts with customers generally do not include a material right. In cases where material rights are granted such as  the award of mobile price plan discount vouchers, a portion of the transaction price is deferred as a contract liability  and is not recognised as revenue until this additional performance obligation has been satisfied or has lapsed. Incentives given to customers are recognised as a reduction from revenue in accordance with the specific terms and  conditions of each contract. Non-refundable, upfront service activation and setup fees associated with service arrangements are deferred and  recognised over the associated service contract period or customer life. The Group may exchange network capacity with other capacity or service providers. The exchange is regarded as a  transaction which generates revenue unless the transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of neither the  capacity received nor the capacity given up is reliably measurable. When the Group has control of goods or services prior to delivery to a customer, the Group is the principal in the sale to  the customer. If another party has control of goods and services prior to transfer to a customer, then the Group is acting  as an agent for the other party and revenue is recognised net of any related payments. The Group typically acts as an  agent for digital mobile content such as music and video. For Infocomm Technology projects, revenue is recognised over time based on the cost-to-cost method, i.e. based on  the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date relative to the estimated total contract costs, while  invoicing is typically based on milestones. A contract asset is recognised for work performed. Any amount previously  recognised as a contract asset is transferred to trade receivable upon invoicing to the customer. If the milestone  payment exceeds the revenue recognised to date, then the Group recognises a contract liability for the difference. Revenues from sale of perpetual software licences and the related hardware are recognised when title passes to the  customer, generally upon delivery. Revenue from data centre services, which primarily consist of recurring monthly service fees and utilities charges, is  recognised when services are rendered. Revenues from digital advertising services and solutions are recognised when advertising services are delivered, and  when digital advertising impressions are delivered or click-throughs occur. Revenue from sale of advertising space is  recognised when the advertising space is filled and sold to customers. Dividend income is recorded gross in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established. Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method. Revenue recognition for leases is described in Note 2.25.1. 152 152  ===== PAGE 155 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.25	 Leases 2.25.1	Sales of network capacity Sales of network capacity are accounted as finance leases where - (i)	 the purchaser’s right of use is exclusive and irrevocable; (ii)	 the asset is specific and separable; (iii)	 the terms of the contract are for the major part of the asset’s economic useful life; (iv)	 the attributable costs or carrying value can be measured reliably; and (v)	 no significant risks are retained by the Group. Sales of network capacity that do not meet the above criteria are accounted for as operating leases. 2.25.2	Lessee accounting The Group is a lessee mainly for central offices, data centres, corporate offices, retail stores, ducts and manholes. The Group implements a single accounting model where lessees recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for all  leases. The Group accounts for short term leases, i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less, as well as low-valued  assets as operating expenses in the income statement over the lease term. A right-of-use asset and a lease liability are recognised at commencement date of the contract for all leases conveying  the right to control the use of identified assets for a period of time. The commencement date is the date on which a  lessor makes an underlying asset available for use by a lessee. Renewal and termination options exercisable by the Group are included in lease terms across the Group if the Group is  reasonably certain that they are to be extended (or not terminated). After the commencement date, the right-of-use assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and  any accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any re-measurement of the lease liability. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the asset’s useful life or the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The  lease payments are discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate or the rate implicit in the lease. After the commencement date, the Group measures the lease liability by: - increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, - reducing the carrying amount to reflect lease payments made, and - re-measuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications. 153 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 153  ===== PAGE 156 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 2.	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) 2.26	 Contract Costs Sales commission and the costs of customer premise equipment directly attributable to obtaining and fulfilling a  customer’s contract are capitalised in the statement of financial position and amortised as operating expenses over the  contract period or expected customer relationship period. Costs to obtain contracts in the form of handset subsidies given to mobile customers via indirect channels are also  capitalised in the statement of financial position but are amortised as a reduction of mobile service revenue over the  contract period or expected customer relationship period. The contract period or expected customer relationship period  typically ranges from 1 year to 5 years. Capitalised contract costs are included in ‘Other Assets’ under non-current assets. 2.27	 Share-based Compensation The performance share plans of the Group are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payments. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The share-based payment  expense is amortised and recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of equity instruments that the  participants are expected to receive based on non-market vesting conditions. The difference is charged or credited to  the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Upon vesting of the performance shares, the weighted average costs of the shares delivered to employees are  transferred from ‘Treasury Shares’ to ‘Capital Reserve’ within equity in the financial statements. The dilutive effects of the Singtel performance share plans are reflected as additional share dilution in the computation  of diluted earnings per share. 2.28	 Dividends Interim and special dividends are recorded in the financial year in which they are declared payable. Final dividends are  recorded in the financial year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders. 2.29	 Exceptional Items Exceptional items refer to items of income or expense within the income statement from ordinary activities that are of  such size, nature or incidence that their separate disclosure is considered necessary to explain the performance for the  financial year. 154 154  ===== PAGE 157 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 3.	 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGEMENTS The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by  definition, seldom be equal to the future actual results. As accounting standards are principles-based, professional  judgement is required under certain circumstances. The estimates, assumptions and judgements that bear a significant  risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below. 3.1	 Impairment Reviews The accounting policies for impairment of non-financial assets are stated in Note 2.20. During an impairment review, the Group assesses whether the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit  exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s  fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use. In making this judgement, the Group evaluates the fair value  less costs of disposal or value-in-use which is supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from  such assets or cash-generating units using cash flow projections which have been discounted at an appropriate rate.  Forecasts of future cash flows are based on the Group’s estimates using historical, sector and industry trends, general  market and economic conditions, changes in technology and other available information. The assumptions used by management for the value-in-use calculations of goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries are  disclosed in Note 26. Goodwill recorded by associates and joint ventures is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. The  impairment assessment requires the exercise of significant judgement about future market conditions, including  growth rates and discount rates applicable in a number of markets where the associates and joint ventures operate.  The carrying values of joint ventures and associates including goodwill capitalised are stated in Note 24 and  Note 25 respectively. 3.2	 Contingent Liabilities The Group consults with its legal counsel on matters related to litigation, and other experts both within and outside  the Group with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. As at 31 March 2024, the Group was involved  in various legal proceedings where it has been vigorously defending its claims as disclosed in Note 42. Assessment on  whether the risk of loss is remote, possible or probable requires significant judgement given the complexities involved. The Group’s associates and joint ventures also report significant contingent liabilities. The significant contingent  liabilities of the Group’s associates and joint ventures are disclosed in Note 43. 3.3	 Revenue Recognition The accounting policies for revenue recognition are stated in Note 2.24. For Infocomm Technology contracts, significant judgements and estimates are made by the Group in the recognition  and measurement of revenue from certain long-term contracts. For these contracts, estimates are required in  determining the budgeted cost and cost to complete to measure the revenue to be recognised. 155 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 155  ===== PAGE 158 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 4.	 OPERATING REVENUE Group 2024 S$ Mil 2023 S$ Mil Mobile service (1)  4,787.0   4,831.9  Sale of equipment  1,899.7   2,054.9  Mobile   6,686.7   6,886.8  Infocomm Technology (“ICT”) (2)  3,774.0   3,846.1  Data and Internet   3,008.7   3,201.6  Fixed voice  331.7   376.5  Pay television   199.1   218.0  Others   127.3   95.4  Operating revenue  14,127.5   14,624.4  Operating revenue  14,127.5   14,624.4  Other income  219.3   195.1  Interest and investment income (see Note 10)  141.3   56.9  Total   14,488.1   14,876.4  	 Notes: 	 (1)	 Included revenues from mobile subscription (prepaid/postpaid), interconnect, outbound and inbound roaming, wholesale revenue from Mobile  Virtual Network Operators and mobile content services such as music and video.

The awards are conditional upon the achievement of predetermined performance targets or vesting  conditions over the performance period of three years. A separate One-Off Long-Term Incentive Award with a five-year  performance period was granted to the members of the Group Management Committee and selected key executives. The awards are to be settled by Singtel shares only. Early vesting of the performance shares can also occur under special circumstances as approved by the Executive  Resource and Compensation Committee such as retirement, redundancy, illness and death while in employment. Though the performance shares are awarded by Singtel, the respective subsidiaries bear all costs and expenses in any  way arising out of, or connected with, the grant and vesting of the awards to their employees. The fair values of the performance shares are estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation methodology at the grant  value dates for equity-settled awards.

The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting  for the top-up tax that may arise from the jurisdictional adoption of the Pillar Two model rules published by the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two exposure. The mandatory exception is effective immediately and applies retrospectively. However, because no new legislation to  implement the top-up tax was enacted or substantively enacted as at 31 March 2023 in any jurisdiction in which the  Group operates and no related deferred tax was recognised at that date, the retrospective application has no impact  on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. In the current financial year, various jurisdictions in which the Group operates in have started the process of enacting  tax legislations to implement the global minimum top-up tax. The Group is closely monitoring the progress of the  legislative process in each jurisdiction that it operates in. As at 31 March 2024, the Group did not have significant subsidiaries in countries where the statutory tax rate is less  than 15%. Accordingly, any top-up tax is not expected to have a significant impact to the Group. 12.2	 Deferred Taxes The Group has adopted Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a  Single Transaction from 1 April 2023. The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption to exclude  transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences – e.g. leases. For leases, an entity is required to recognise the associated deferred tax assets and liabilities from the beginning of the  earliest comparative period presented, with any cumulative effect recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings or  other components of equity at that date. The Group previously accounted for deferred tax on leases by applying the ‘integrally linked’ approach, resulting in a  similar outcome as under the amendments, except that the deferred tax asset or liability was recognised on a net basis.  Following the amendments, the Group has recognised a separate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and  a deferred tax liability in relation to its right-of-use assets. However, there was no impact on the statement of financial  position because the balances qualify for offset under paragraph 74 of SFRS(I) 1-12. There was also no impact on  the opening retained earnings as at 1 April 2022 as a result of the change. The key impact for the Group relates to  disclosure of the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised. Taxation The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is involved in determining the group-wide  provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination  is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based  on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the  amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the  period in which such determination is made. 169 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 169  ===== PAGE 172 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 12.	 TAXATION (Cont'd) 12.2	 Deferred Taxes (Cont'd) The movements of the deferred tax assets and liabilities (prior to offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction)  during the financial year were as follows - Group - 2024 Deferred tax assets Provisions S$ Mil TWDV (1) in excess of NBV (2) of depreciable assets S$ Mil Others S$ Mil Total S$ Mil Balance as at 1 April 2023  65.5   (82.4)  728.9   712.0  Disposal of a subsidiary  (1.1)  -   (14.7)  (15.8) (Charged)/Credited to income statement   (2.0)  137.8   9.3   145.1  Charged to other comprehensive income   -   -   (2.0)  (2.0) Transfer from current tax  142.7   -   -   142.7  Translation differences  (0.9)  1.2   (0.8)  (0.5) Balance as at 31 March 2024  204.2   56.6   720.7   981.5  Group - 2024 Deferred tax liabilities Accelerated tax depreciation S$ Mil Offshore interest and dividend not remitted S$ Mil Others S$ Mil Total S$ Mil Balance as at 1 April 2023  (498.8)  (0.2)  (450.1)  (949.1) Disposal of subsidiaries  5.6   -   (2.1)  3.5  Credited/(Charged) to income statement   6.6   (0.3)  (6.0)  0.3  Transfer to current tax   -   -   24.9   24.9  Translation differences   (4.7)  -   4.0   (0.7) Balance as at 31 March 2024  (491.3)  (0.5)  (429.3)  (921.1) Group - 2023 Deferred tax assets Provisions S$ Mil TWDV (1) in excess of NBV (2) of depreciable assets S$ Mil Others S$ Mil Total S$ Mil Balance as at 1 April 2022  73.7   (66.4)  634.4   641.7  Acquisition of subsidiaries  -   -   5.0   5.0  Credited/(Charged) to income statement   1.0   (25.1)  162.9   138.8  Charged to other comprehensive income   -   -   (9.7)  (9.7) Transfer to current tax  (0.1)  -   (0.1)  (0.2) Translation differences  (9.1)  9.1   (63.6)  (63.6) Balance as at 31 March 2023  65.5   (82.4)  728.9   712.0  170 170  ===== PAGE 173 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 12.	 TAXATION (Cont'd) 12.2	 Deferred Taxes (Cont'd) Group - 2023 Deferred tax liabilities Accelerated tax depreciation S$ Mil Offshore interest and dividend not remitted S$ Mil Others S$ Mil Total S$ Mil Balance as at 1 April 2022  (482.4)  (5.4)  (343.3)  (831.1) Acquisition of subsidiaries  -   -   (37.7)  (37.7) (Charged)/Credited to income statement   (16.4)  5.2   (76.5)  (87.7) Transfer from current tax   -   -   (31.5)  (31.5) Translation differences   -   -   38.9   38.9  Balance as at 31 March 2023  (498.8)  (0.2)  (450.1)  (949.1) Company - 2024 Deferred tax assets Provisions  S$ Mil Others S$ Mil Total  S$ Mil Balance as at 1 April 2023  0.4   80.7   81.1  Credited/(Charged) to income statement   0.4   (7.6)  (7.2) Balance as at 31 March 2024  0.8   73.1   73.9  Company - 2024 Deferred tax liabilities Accelerated tax depreciation S$ Mil Offshore   interest and  dividend not  remitted   S$ Mil Others  S$ Mil Total  S$ Mil Balance as at 1 April 2023  (276.0)  -   (62.4)  (338.4) (Charged)/Credited to income statement   (11.2)  (0.1)  4.1   (7.2) Balance as at 31 March 2024  (287.2)  (0.1)  (58.3)  (345.6) Company - 2023 Deferred tax assets Provisions S$ Mil Others S$ Mil Total  S$ Mil Balance as at 1 April 2022  0.3   109.6   109.9  Credited/(Charged) to income statement   0.1   (28.9)  (28.8) Balance as at 31 March 2023  0.4   80.7   81.1  171 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 171  ===== PAGE 174 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 12.	 TAXATION (Cont'd) 12.2	 Deferred Taxes (Cont'd) Company - 2023 Deferred tax liabilities Accelerated tax depreciation S$ Mil Others S$ Mil Total S$ Mil Balance as at 1 April 2022  (263.5)  (83.1)  (346.6) (Charged)/Credited to income statement  (12.5) 20.7 8.2 Balance as at 31 March 2023  (276.0)  (62.4)  (338.4) 	 Notes: 	 (1)	 TWDV – Tax written down value 	 (2)	 NBV – Net book value Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets  against current tax liabilities, and when deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

The Group reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at each reporting date. A deferred tax asset is  recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary  differences can be utilised. This involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal  entity or tax group for which the deferred tax asset has been recognised. As at 31 March 2024, the subsidiaries of the Group had estimated unutilised income tax losses of approximately S$60  million (31 March 2023: S$1.15 billion), of which S$13 million (31 March 2023: S$135 million) will expire in the next five  years. Unutilised income tax losses are available for set-off against future taxable profits, subject to the agreement  of the relevant tax authorities and compliance with certain provisions of the income tax regulations of the respective  countries in which the subsidiaries operate. 172 172  ===== PAGE 175 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 12.	 TAXATION (Cont'd) 12.2	 Deferred Taxes (Cont'd) As at the end of the reporting period, the potential tax benefits arising from the following items were not recognised in  the financial statements due to uncertainty on their recoverability – Group  2024 S$ Mil 2023 S$ Mil Unutilised income tax losses  59.6   1,148.3  Unutilised capital tax losses  53.6   50.6  13.	 EARNINGS PER SHARE Group 2024 ‘000 2023 ‘000 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for  calculation of basic earnings per share (1)  16,506,284   16,505,968  Adjustment for dilutive effects of performance share plans  49,886   49,579  Weighted average number of ordinary shares for calculation  of diluted earnings per share  16,556,170   16,555,547  	 Note: 	 (1)	 Adjusted to exclude the number of performance shares held by the Trust and the Company.

The allowance  for ECL is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of individual customer accounts taking into  consideration the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. The Group also records an allowance  for all other receivables based on management’s collective assessment of their collectability taking into consideration  multiple factors including historical experience of credit losses, forward looking information as applicable and the aging  of the receivables with allowances generally increasing as the receivable ages. If there is a deterioration of customers’  financial condition or if future default rates in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Group may have to  adjust the allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period that adjustments are made. The expected credit losses for debts which are collectively assessed are estimated based on a provision matrix  by reference to historical credit loss experience of the different segments, adjusted as appropriate to reflect current  conditions and estimates of future economic conditions as applicable. The expected credit losses for debts which are  individually assessed are based on an analysis of the debtor’s current financial position and are adjusted for factors  that are specific to the debtors. 177 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 177  ===== PAGE 180 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 17.	 INVENTORIES Group Company 31 March 2024 S$ Mil 31 March 2023 S$ Mil 31 March 2024 S$ Mil 31 March 2023 S$ Mil Equipment held for resale 241.5 296.6 2.2 4.4 Maintenance and capital works' inventories 59.9 49.6 59.3 47.6 301.4 346.2 61.5 52.0 18.	 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Group Company 2024 S$ Mil 2023 S$ Mil 2024 S$ Mil 2023 S$ Mil Balance as at 1 April (550.3) (333.7) (176.3) (100.8) Fair value gains/(losses) - included in income statement 143.5 (177.2) (0.8) (89.3) - included in 'Hedging Reserve' (59.5) (22.3) (13.3) 13.8 Settlement of swaps for bonds repaid - (8.3) - - Others (8.6) (19.2) - - Translation differences 1.1 10.4 - - Balance as at 31 March (473.8) (550.3) (190.4) (176.3) Group Company 31 March 2024 S$ Mil 31 March 2023 S$ Mil 31 March 2024 S$ Mil 31 March 2023 S$ Mil Disclosed as - Current asset 29.2 69.4 0.6 0.1 Non-current asset 161.1 157.7 25.9 23.4 Current liability (14.8) (48.2) (10.6) (2.3) Non-current liability (649.3) (729.2) (206.3) (197.5) (473.8) (550.3) (190.4) (176.3) 18.1	 Fair Values The fair values of the currency and interest rate swap contracts excluded accrued interest of S$5.1 million  (31 March 2023: S$3.6 million).

Property, plant and  equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment on an annual basis based on factors  such as business plans and strategies, expected level of usage and future technological developments. It is possible  that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in these estimates brought about by changes  in the factors mentioned above. A reduction in the estimated useful lives would increase the recorded depreciation and  decrease the carrying value of property, plant and equipment. In line with the overall decline that was witnessed in the Australian enterprise market, Optus has been reporting steep  declines in fixed carriage revenue due to churn and price erosion, which has led to lower recovery value. As a result, the  Group recorded non-cash impairment charges of S$513 million (2023: Nil) mainly on its enterprise fixed access network  assets in Australia. 21.	 RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS Group - 2024 Mobile base stations/ Central offices S$ Mil Other properties S$ Mil Equipment S$ Mil Others S$ Mil Total S$ Mil Cost Balance as at 1 April 2023 3,175.0 896.9 512.8 15.2 4,599.9 Additions (net of rebates) 202.9 468.9 4.1 3.6 679.5 Disposals/Write-offs (77.0) (40.5) (2.7) (4.2) (124.4) Disposal of a subsidiary -

Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes based on cash-generating unit (“CGU”). The recoverable values of CGUs including goodwill are assessed based on discounted cash flow models using cash flow  projections from financial budgets and forecasts approved by management. The Group has used cash flow projections  of seven years for Optus to better reflect the longer time period for investment returns and five years for NCS Group  and Asia Pacific Cyber Security Business. Cash flows beyond the terminal year are extrapolated using the estimated  growth rates stated in the table below. Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models are growth rates,  operating margins, capital expenditure and discount rates. The terminal growth rates used do not exceed the long term average growth rates of the respective industry and  country in which the entity operates and are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports. The discount rates applied to the cash flow projections are based on Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) where  the cost of a company’s debt and equity capital are weighted to reflect its capital structure. The details are shown in the table below: Group 31 March 2024 S$ Mil 31 March 2023 S$ Mil Terminal growth rate (1) Pre-tax discount rate 31 March 2024 31 March 2023 31 March 2024 31 March 2023 Carrying value of goodwill in - Optus Group 5,868.4 7,857.4 2.75% 2.75% 9.4% 9.1% 	 Asia Pacific Cyber Security 	 	 Business 270.2 610.6 3.0% 3.5% 10.8% 11.8% NCS (Australia) (2) (3) - 456.7 2.5% 2.0% 16.7% 12.3% NCS (Asia) (3) 272.8 97.2 2.0% 2.0% 11.2% 11.9% Notes: (1)	 Weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the terminal year. (2)	 Included NCS’s businesses in Australia including Dialog Pty Ltd and Row TopCo Pty Ltd (the group holding company of ARQ Group). (3)	 As at 31 March 2024, goodwill of S$175 million (A$200 million) was allocated from NCS (Australia) to NCS (Asia) as synergies were identified from  the acquisitions in Australia with NCS (Asia). As part of the Singtel Group’s review of its investments, the recovery value of Optus Group was assessed to be below  its carrying value as at 31 March 2024. This reflected a range of factors including weaker prospects in the enterprise  market, increased cost of capital and the softer macroeconomic outlook in Australia partly offset by the benefit from  the regional Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) agreement which Optus has entered into with TPG Telecom Limited.  Consequently, the Group recorded a non-cash impairment provision of S$2.0 billion on the goodwill of Optus. The  Group also recorded a non-cash impairment provision for goodwill of S$340 million for the Asia Pacific Cyber Security  Business mainly from general business weakness on lower corporate spending. In addition, a non-cash impairment  provision of S$280 million (A$320 million) was recorded for NCS (Australia) due mainly to higher cost of capital. 197 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 197  ===== PAGE 200 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 26.	 IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS (Cont'd) Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries (Cont'd) The impairment charges were based on the Group’s best estimates.

The secured borrowings of the Company comprised lease liabilities in respect of  right-of-use assets. The application of SFRS(I) 16 requires the Group to exercise judgement and estimates in the determination of key  assumptions used in measuring the lease liabilities. Key assumptions include lease terms and discount rates on the  lease payments. In determining the lease term, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic  incentive for the Group to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Extension options (or  periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an  option to extend the lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. This  requires the Group to estimate the rate of interest that it would have to pay to borrow the funds to obtain a similar asset  over a similar term. Changes in these assumptions may impact the measurement of the lease liabilities. The accounting policies for leases are stated in Note 2.25. 204 204  ===== PAGE 207 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 30.	 BORROWINGS (SECURED) (Cont'd) 30.1	 Maturity The maturity periods of the non-current secured borrowings at the end of the reporting period were as follows – Group Company 31 March 2024 S$ Mil 31 March 2023 S$ Mil 31 March 2024 S$ Mil 31 March 2023 S$ Mil Between 1 and 5 years 1,926.8 1,335.9 132.5 139.3 Over 5 years 1,177.8 1,432.3 204.3 233.5 3,104.6 2,768.2 336.8 372.8 30.2	 The tables below set out the maturity profile of secured borrowings based on expected contractual undiscounted cash  flows - Group Less than 1 year S$ Mil Between 1 and 5 years S$ Mil Over 5 years S$ Mil As at 31 March 2024 Net-settled interest rate swaps (4.5) (13.1) - Borrowings 732.1 2,322.9 2,438.6 727.6 2,309.8 2,438.6 As at 31 March 2023 Borrowings 630.8 1,713.4 2,621.2 Company Less than 1 year S$ Mil Between 1 and 5 years S$ Mil Over 5 years S$ Mil As at 31 March 2024 Borrowings 76.4 174.9 234.9 As at 31 March 2023 Borrowings 73.8 184.8 272.9 205 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 205  ===== PAGE 208 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 31.	 RECONCILIATION OF LIABILITIES FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES Group - 2024 Bonds S$ Mil Bank loans S$ Mil Other borrowings S$ Mil Lease liabilities S$ Mil Interest payable S$ Mil Derivative financial instruments S$ Mil As at 1 April 2023 7,027.7 542.9 42.9 3,279.8 97.3 550.3 Financing cash flows (1) (82.9) 1,168.8 (6.4) (417.4) (416.7) - Non-cash changes: Fair value adjustments 9.1 - - - - (0.3) Amortisation of bond discount 4.9 - - - - - Foreign exchange movements 42.7 0.3 (0.7) (35.9) 19.2 (84.8) Additions of lease liabilities - - - 359.0 - - Interest expense - - - - 416.2 - Disposal of a subsidiary - - - (30.3) - - Disposals - - - (4.9) - - Adjustments/Reclassifications - - - - - 8.6 56.7 0.3 (0.7) 287.9 435.4 (76.5) As at 31 March 2024 7,001.5 1,712.0 35.8 3,150.3 116.0 473.8 Group - 2023 Bonds S$ Mil Bank loans S$ Mil Other borrowings S$ Mil Lease liabilities S$ Mil Interest payable S$ Mil Derivative financial instruments S$ Mil As at 1 April 2022 8,245.3 - 30.8 3,592.5 93.2 333.7 Financing cash flows (1) (766.6) 542.4 16.6 (433.7) (389.6) 8.3 Non-cash changes: Fair value adjustments (123.4) - - - - 201.5 Amortisation of bond discount 6.2 - - - - - Foreign exchange movements (333.8) (14.5) (4.5) (346.7) 4.0 (12.4) Additions of lease liabilities - - - 457.4 - - Interest expense - - - - 389.7 - Acquisition of subsidiaries - 15.0 - 13.0 - - Disposals - - - (2.7) - - Adjustments/Reclassifications - - - - - 19.2 (451.0) 0.5 (4.5) 121.0 393.7 208.3 As at 31 March 2023 7,027.7 542.9 42.9 3,279.8 97.3 550.3 Note: (1)	 The cash flows comprised the net amount of proceeds from borrowings and repayments of borrowings, net interest paid on borrowings and  settlement of swaps for bonds repaid in the statement of cash flows. 206 206  ===== PAGE 209 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 32.	 NET DEFERRED GAIN Group 31 March 2024 S$ Mil 31 March 2023 S$ Mil Unamortised deferred gain 346.2 363.2 Reclassification from 'Associates' (see Note 25) 19.4 3.3 Net deferred gain 365.6 366.5 Classified as - Current 21.0 20.8 Non-current 344.6 345.7 365.6 366.5 NetLink Trust (“NLT”) is a business trust established as part of the Infocomm Media Development Authority of  Singapore’s effective open access requirements under Singapore’s Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network.

At the consolidated level, the gain on disposal of Assets recognised by Singtel is deferred in the  Group’s statement of financial position and amortised over the useful lives of the Assets. The unamortised deferred  gain is released to the Group’s income statement when NLT is partially or fully sold, based on the proportionate equity  interest disposed. Singtel sold its 100% interest in NLT to NetLink NBN Trust (the “Trust”) in July 2017 for cash as well as a 24.8% interest in  the Trust.

The issued shares carry one vote per share and a right to  dividends as and when declared by the Company. From time to time, the Group purchases its own shares from the market. The shares purchased are primarily for delivery  to employees upon vesting of performance shares awarded under Singtel performance share plans. The Group can  also cancel the shares which are repurchased from the market. Dividend Policy and Capital Management Singtel is focused on a disciplined capital management approach of balancing investing for growth and delivering  strong, sustainable total returns to shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility and investment-grade credit  ratings. This is achieved through improving business performance and commitment to an asset recycling programme. Barring unforeseen circumstances, Singtel plans to pay ordinary dividends comprising: •	 A core dividend at between 70% and 90% of underlying net profit, which will track business performance.  Underlying net profit is defined as net profit before exceptional items. •	 A value realisation dividend of 3 - 6 cents per share per annum over the medium term, funded by excess capital  generated from asset recycling proceeds after investing in growth initiatives. This policy will be reviewed periodically in line with the Group’s evolving business strategy and market conditions. 35.	 PERPETUAL SECURITIES On 14 April 2021, the Group issued fixed rate subordinated perpetual securities (the “perpetual securities”) with an  aggregate principal amount of S$1.0 billion. Incremental costs incurred of S$2.6 million were recognised in equity as a  deduction from the proceeds. Such perpetual securities bear distribution at a rate of 3.3% per annum, payable semi-annually. Subject to relevant  terms and conditions in the offering memorandum, the Group may elect to defer making distributions on the perpetual  securities, and is not subject to any limit as to the number of times a distribution can be deferred. As a result, the Group is considered to have no contractual obligations to repay its principal or to pay any distributions  and the perpetual securities do not meet the definition for classification as a financial liability under SFRS(I) 1-32  Financial Instruments: Presentation. The whole instrument is presented within equity, and distributions are treated  as dividends. During the financial year, distributions to perpetual securities holders amounting to S$33.1 million (31 March 2023:  S$33.0 million) were accrued of which S$33.0 million (31 March 2023: S$33.0 million) has been paid. 208 208  ===== PAGE 211 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 36.	 DIVIDENDS Group Company 2024 S$ Mil 2023 S$ Mil 2024 S$ Mil 2023 S$ Mil Final dividend of 5.3 cents  (2023: 4.8 cents) per share 875.0 792.5 875.0 792.5 Interim dividend of 5.2 cents  (2023: 4.6 cents) per share 858.3 759.2 858.3 759.2 Special dividend of nil  (2023: 5.0) per share - 825.2 - 825.2 1,733.3 2,376.9 1,733.3 2,376.9 During the f﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿inancial year, (a)	 a final one-tier tax exempt ordinary dividend of 5.3 cents per share, totalling S$875 million was paid in respect  of the previous financial year ended 31 March 2023.

The Directors have proposed a final one-tier tax exempt ordinary dividend of 9.8 cents per share, totalling  approximately S$1.62 billion in respect of the current financial year ended 31 March 2024 for approval at the  forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The dividend consists of: (a)	 a core dividend of 6.0 cents per share; and (b)	 a value realisation dividend of 3.8 cents per share. The value realisation dividend is to be paid in two tranches of 1.9 cents per share each in August 2024 and December  2024 to shareholders on Singtel’s register at each respective record date. The Singtel Scrip Dividend Scheme will not be  applied to the final dividend.

The Group’s overall risk management seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects of  these risks on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses financial instruments such as currency forwards, cross currency and interest rate swaps, and  foreign currency borrowings to hedge certain financial risk exposures. No financial derivatives are held or sold for  speculative purposes. The Directors assume responsibility for the overall financial risk management of the Group. For the financial year ended  31 March 2024, the Risk Committee, and Finance and Investment Committee (“FIC”), which are committees of the  Board, assisted the Directors in reviewing and establishing policies relating to financial risk management in accordance  with the policies and directives of the Group. 212 212  ===== PAGE 215 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 38.	 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (Cont'd) 38.2	 Foreign Exchange Risk The foreign exchange risk of the Group arises from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures operating in foreign  countries, mainly Australia, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. Additionally, the Group’s joint venture in India,  Airtel, is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risks from its operations in Sri Lanka and across Africa. Translation risks  of overseas net investments are not hedged unless approved by the FIC. The Group has borrowings denominated in foreign currencies that have primarily been hedged into the functional  currency of the respective borrowing entities using cross currency swaps in order to reduce the foreign currency  exposure on these borrowings. As the hedges are intended to be perfect, any change in the fair value of the cross  currency swaps has minimal impact on profit and equity. The Group Treasury Policy, as approved by the FIC, is to substantially hedge all known transactional currency  exposures. The Group generates revenue, receives foreign dividends and incurs costs in currencies which are other than  the functional currencies of the operating units, thus giving rise to foreign exchange risk. The currency exposures are  primarily from the Australian Dollar, Euro, Hong Kong Dollar, Indian Rupee, Indonesian Rupiah, Philippine Peso, Pound  Sterling, Thai Baht, United States Dollar and Japanese Yen. Foreign currency purchases and forward currency contracts are used to reduce the Group’s transactional exposure to  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The foreign exchange difference on trade balances is disclosed in Note 6  and the foreign exchange difference on non-trade balances is disclosed in Note 10. The critical terms (i.e. the notional amount, maturity and underlying) of the derivative financial instruments and their  corresponding hedged items are the same. The Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is  expected that derivative financial instruments and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically  change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying exchange rates. The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the  Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the derivative financial instruments, which is not reflected in the fair value  of the hedged items attributable to changes in foreign currency rates. No other source of ineffectiveness emerged from  these hedging relationships. All hedge relationships remain effective and there is no hedge relationship in which hedge accounting is no  longer applied. 38.3	 Interest Rate Risk The Group has cash balances placed with reputable banks and financial institutions which generate interest income for  the Group. Other than cash placed with banks and financial institutions, the Group also invested in Singapore Treasury  bills. The Group manages its interest rate risks by placing its cash balances and investing in Singapore Treasury bills on  varying maturities and interest rate terms. The Group’s borrowings include bank borrowings and bonds. The borrowings expose the Group to interest rate risk.  The Group seeks to minimise its exposure to these risks by entering into interest rate swaps over the duration of its  borrowings. Interest rate swaps entail the Group agreeing to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between  fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As at  31 March 2024, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 87% (31 March 2023: 89%) of  the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates of interest. 213 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 213  ===== PAGE 216 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 38.	 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (Cont'd) 38.3	 Interest Rate Risk (Cont'd) As at 31 March 2024, assuming that the market interest rate is 50 basis points higher or lower and with no change to  the other variables, the annualised interest expense on borrowings would be higher or lower by S$4.0 million (2023:  S$3.1 million). The critical terms (i.e. the notional amount, maturity and underlying) of the derivative financial instruments and their  corresponding hedged items are the same. The Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is  expected that derivative financial instruments and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically  change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying interest rates. The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of the counterparty and  the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is not reflected in the fair value of the  hedge items attributable to changes in interest rates. No other source of ineffectiveness emerged from these  hedging relationships. Interest rate swap contracts paying fixed rate interest amounts are designated and effective as cash flow hedges  in reducing the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate  swaps and the interest payments on the borrowings occur simultaneously and the amount accumulated in equity is  reclassified to the income statement over the period that the floating rate interest payments on borrowings affect the  income statement. Interest rate swap contracts paying floating rate interest amounts are designated and effective as fair value hedges of  interest rate movements. During the year, the hedge was fully effective in hedging the fair value exposure to interest  rate movements. The carrying amount of the bond decreased by S$197.7 million (31 March 2023: S$213.5 million)  which was included in the income statement at the same time that the fair value of the interest rate swap was included  in the income statement. As at 31 March 2024, S$1.4 billion (31 March 2023: S$1.3 billion) of borrowings were designated in fair value hedge  relationships. All hedge relationships remained effective and there was no hedge relationship in which hedge  accounting could no longer be applied. 38.4	 Credit Risk Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables,  contract assets, cash and cash equivalents, Singapore Treasury bills and financial instruments used in hedging activities. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk from trade receivables and contract assets due to its diverse  customer base. Credit risk is managed through the application of credit assessment and approvals, credit limits and  monitoring procedures. Where appropriate, the Group obtains deposits or bank guarantees from customers or enters  into credit insurance arrangements. The Group’s exposure to credit risk and the measurement bases used to determine  expected credit losses is disclosed in Note 16. The Group places its cash and cash equivalents with a number of major commercial banks and other financial  institutions with high credit ratings. The Group also invested in Singapore Treasury bills which has been accorded the  strongest credit rating by international credit rating agencies. Derivative counterparties are limited to high credit rating commercial banks and other financial institutions. The Group  has policies that limit the financial exposure to any one financial institution. 214 214  ===== PAGE 217 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 38.	 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (Cont'd) 38.5	 Liquidity Risk To manage liquidity risk, the Group monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents, as well as its  investment in Singapore Treasury bills, deemed adequate by the management to finance the Group’s operations and  to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, the Group  maintains funding flexibility with adequate committed and uncommitted credit lines available to ensure that the Group  is able to meet the short-term obligations of the Group as they fall due. The maturity profile of the Group’s borrowings and related swaps based on expected contractual undiscounted cash  flows is disclosed in Note 29.6 and Note 30.2. 38.6	 Market Risk The Group has investments in quoted equity shares. The market value of these investments will fluctuate with  market conditions. 39.	 SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment information is presented based on the information reviewed by senior management for performance  measurement and resource allocation. From 1 April 2023, the Group’s segment reporting has been changed to reflect the Group’s new organisation structure.  The results for the comparative periods have been restated on the same basis.

On 8 January 2013, Department of Telecommunications (“DOT”) issued a demand on Airtel Group for Rs. 52.01  billion (S$842 million) towards levy of one time spectrum charge, which was further revised on 27 June 2018 to  Rs. 84.14 billion (S$1.36 billion), excluding related interest. In the opinion of Airtel, the above demand amounts  to alteration of the terms of the licences issued in the past. Airtel had filed a petition with the Hon’ble High Court  of Bombay, which has directed DOT not to take any coercive action until the next date of hearing. The matter is  currently pending with the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay. On 4 July 2019, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal in a similar matter of another unrelated  telecom service provider, passed an order providing partial relief and confirming the basis for the balance of the  one time spectrum charge. The said telecom service provider filed an appeal in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of  India which was dismissed on 16 March 2020. With the ruling, Airtel Group has assessed and provided Rs. 18.08  billion (S$293 million) of the principal demand as well as the related interest. Notwithstanding this, Airtel Group  intends to continue to pursue its legal remedies. Other taxes, custom duties and demands under adjudication, appeal or disputes and related interest for some  disputes as at 31 March 2024 amounted to approximately Rs. 167.6 billion (S$2.71 billion). In respect of some of  the tax issues, pending final decisions, Airtel had deposited amounts with statutory authorities. (b)	 AIS, a joint venture of the Group, has various commercial disputes and significant litigations which are  pending adjudication. National Telecom Public Company Limited (“NT”) has demanded that AIS pay the following: (i)	 additional charges for porting of subscribers from 900MHz to 2100MHz network of THB 41.1 billion  (S$1.52 billion) plus interest. In September 2023, the Central Administrative Court (“CAC”) supported  the arbitration award which was in favour of AIS. In October 2023, NT appealed to the Supreme  Administrative Court (“SAC”). (ii)	 additional revenue share of THB 62.8 billion (S$2.32 billion) arising from what NT claims to be an illegality  of two amendments made to the Concession Agreement, namely, Amendment 6 (regarding reduction in  prepaid revenue share rate) made in 2001 and Amendment 7 (regarding deduction of roaming expense  from revenue share) made in 2002, which have resulted in lower revenue share. In January 2020, AIS  received the award from the Arbitral Tribunal (“AT”) to pay THB 31.1 billion (S$1.15 billion) and 1.25%  interest per month after 30 November 2015. In April 2020, AIS filed a motion to the CAC to set aside the  award which was followed by NT’s appeal to the CAC to increase the award to THB 62.8 billion (S$2.32  billion). In July 2022, the CAC revoked the AT’s resolution and AIS is not required to pay the additional  revenue share of THB 62.8 billion (S$2.32 billion). In August 2022, NT appealed to the SAC. (iii)	 additional revenue share from disputes on roaming rates from 2013 to 2015 of THB 16.3 billion (S$601  million). In December 2023, the CAC dismissed the case and NT is eligible to appeal to the SAC. As at 31 March 2024, other claims against AIS and its subsidiaries which are pending adjudication amounted to  THB 12.2 billion (S$453 million). The above claims have not included potential interest and penalty. AIS believes that the above claims will be settled in favour of AIS and will have no material impact to its  financial statements. 222 222  ===== PAGE 225 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 43.	 SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES (Cont'd) (c)	 In October 2017, Intouch and its former subsidiary, Thaicom Public Company Limited (“Thaicom”), received  letters from the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (the “Ministry”) stating that Thaicom 7 and Thaicom  8 satellites (the “Satellites”) are governed under the terms of a 1991 satellite operating agreement between  Intouch and the Ministry (“Agreement”) which entails the transfer of asset ownership, procurement of backup  satellites, payment of revenue share, and procurement of property insurance. Intouch and Thaicom have  obtained legal advice and are of the opinion that the Satellites are not covered under the Agreement but instead  under the licence from the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (“NBTC”). In September  2022, the arbitrators ruled against the Ministry and stated that Intouch is not obligated to comply with the  Ministry’s claim under this dispute. In December 2022, the Ministry appealed to the Central Administrative Court  (“CAC”). In November 2020, Intouch and Thaicom received notices from the Ministry requesting for replacement of the  de-orbited Thaicom 5 satellite, or compensation equivalent to the value of satellite at THB 7.8 billion (S$289  million) plus fines and interest. This case is pending arbitration. In June 2021, Intouch and Thaicom received letters from NBTC stating that Thaicom’s rights to use the orbital  slots of Thaicom 7 and Thaicom 8 satellites were up to 10 September 2021 only. Thaicom filed a complaint to the  CAC and the CAC has granted an injunction on 9 August 2021 protecting Thaicom’s rights to use these orbital  slots until the CAC issues the order. In June 2022, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the CAC’s decision. (d)	 Globe, a joint venture of the Group, is contingently liable for various claims arising in the ordinary conduct of  business and certain tax assessments which are either pending decision by the Courts or are being contested,  the outcome of which are not presently determinable. In the opinion of Globe’s management and legal counsel,  the eventual liability under these claims, if any, will not have a material or adverse effect on Globe’s financial  position and results of operations. In June 2016, the Philippine Competition Commission (“PCC”) claimed that the Joint Notice of Acquisition filed by  Globe, PLDT Inc. (“PLDT”) and San Miguel Corporation (“SMC”) on the acquisition of SMC’s telecommunications  business was deficient and cannot be claimed to be deemed approved. In July 2016, Globe filed a petition with  the Court of Appeals of the Philippines (“CA”) to stop the PCC from reviewing the acquisition. In October 2017,  the CA ruled in favour of Globe and PLDT, and declared the acquisition as valid and deemed approved. PCC  subsequently elevated the case to the Supreme Court to review the CA’s rulings. (e)	 As at 31 March 2024, Telkomsel, a joint venture of the Group, has filed appeals and cross-appeals amounting to  approximately IDR 374 billion (S$32 million) for various tax claims arising in certain tax assessments which are  pending final decisions, the outcome of which is not presently determinable. 223 Overview Business Reviews Governance and Sustainability Performance Financials Additional Information 223  ===== PAGE 226 ===== Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 44.	 SUBSEQUENT EVENT In April 2024, Optus signed an agreement with TPG Telecom Limited to create a regional Multi-Operator Core Network  (MOCN). Optus expects to receive total service fees of approximately S$1.4 billion (A$1.6 billion) over the 11-year  term of the agreement with incremental cash flows of approximately S$789 million (A$900 million) expected over the  same period. 45.	 EFFECTS OF SFRS(I) AND INT SFRS(I) ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED Certain new or revised SFRS(I) and INT SFRS(I) are mandatory for adoption by the Group for the financial year  beginning on or after 1 April 2024.

While it has  been a challenging year for us, we are  committed to being transparent and  sharing the meaningful progress we  have made against our sustainability  strategy, as well as the challenges  faced. Our commitment to this is evident  through our actions, outlined here.  Taking bolder climate action  We have made progress reducing our emissions based  on our original Science Based Target initiative (SBTi)  targets set in 2017. During the year, together with the  Singtel Group, we renewed our emissions reductions  targets, validated by SBTi and aligned with the goals  of the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit  global warming to 1.5°C. Together with the Singtel  Group, we have committed to achieve net zero  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2045 (brought  forward from 2050). This includes a commitment to  further reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions  by 55% and Scope 3 emissions by 40% across our  operations and supply chain between FY23 and FY30.  Our efforts to reduce emissions are focused on  improving our energy efficiency, decommissioning  legacy systems and increasing our use of renewable  energy to help us achieve our Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions reduction targets. Steps we have taken this  year include launching our National Solar Program at  five key exchanges and satellite sites and signing our  first Power Purchase Agreement, which is expected  to increase the share of electricity from renewable  sources to 42% from January 2025. We recognise  the importance of a multi-pronged approach to our  operational emissions reductions given the volatility  of the energy markets of the past few years and the  increasing challenges in the renewable energy sector  due to escalating supply chain costs and transmission  curtailment.  Digital enablement  We recognise the transformative power of  connectivity in bridging the digital divide and driving  socio-economic development. Through our flagship  initiatives like Digital Thumbprint and Donate Your  Data,™ we continue to educate young people on digital  safety, improve their digital wellbeing and expand  access and connectivity to those who need it most. In  FY24, we celebrated 10 years of our Digital Thumbprint  program, which has educated over 620,000 students  from over 1,100 unique schools. We also launched new  resources that provide our customers with practical  tools, such as our new First Phone Quiz and Guide,  to help parents and caregivers evaluate their child’s  readiness for their first phone. 4 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Equity and inclusion  This year we launched our first Reflect Reconciliation  Action Plan (RAP), demonstrating our commitment  towards inclusivity and making meaningful progress  with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,  communities, partners and businesses. Our RAP  Steering Committee and Working Groups will  ensure we continue to make progress against the  commitments outlined in our RAP.  We remain committed to respecting the human  rights of all individuals and maintaining responsible  supply chain practices. This year we released our  fourth Modern Slavery Statement, progressed the  development of our supplier engagement roadmap  and commenced the review of selected suppliers in  high-risk supplier categories.  Strengthening resilience and   reliability for our customers  Strengthening network resilience remains a priority   for our business following the cyber attack and  network outage our customers experienced last year.  The network outage on 8 November 2023 was a  challenging experience for our customers and for  our community. We are sorry that in this instance   we fell short of delivering the services the community  and our customers expect. We remain committed   to continuously strengthening the resiliency of   our network.  This year we also launched a new Australian-based  specialist care team to support our vulnerable  customers to access and maintain connectivity during  challenging times. The team has provided tailored  support to over 2,600 vulnerable customers in the  form of financial relief and specific connectivity issues.  Looking forward  As we look ahead, we remain steadfast in our  commitment to sustainability. We will continue  to innovate, collaborate and demonstrate that  responsible business practices are not only good for  people and the planet, but essential for long-term  business success.   We would like to thank all our amazing people and our  dedicated sustainability team at Optus, whose passion  and commitment continues to drive progress on our  sustainability strategy and targets. We also thank our  valued customers and stakeholders for their ongoing  support as they continue to journey with us.

This report  gives our stakeholders a closer look at  our sustainability strategy, targets,  initiatives and performance across  Environmental, Social and Governance  (ESG) matters and is aligned with our  sustainability strategy and six focus  areas: Climate Action, Circular Economy,  Digital Enablement, Sustainable  Innovation, Future of Work and Equity  and Inclusion. Optus is a subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications  Limited (‘Singtel’). Our sustainability performance and  impact are outlined in this report, and our ESG data  and activities are integrated into the Singtel Group  Sustainability Report 2024 and the Singtel Group  Annual Report 2024. The Singtel Group Report also  contains further details of the reporting standards  used to guide our reporting, our employee policies and  our broader ESG focus as a Group. Since 2008 we  have referenced the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  universal standards as a guide when reporting on  sustainability activities and outcomes. You can view  our activities against the GRI topics and indicators in  the Singtel Group Sustainability Report. We are aware  of the proposed Australian Sustainability Reporting  Standards (ASRS) and their key reporting domains  and are assessing their relevance and applicability   to Optus. As part of our Group reporting, EY Singapore has  provided limited assurance on a selection of our key  ESG disclosures. You can view their assurance report  in the Singtel Group Sustainability Report. We have  emissions reduction targets validated by the Science  Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and we use the  Business for Societal Impact methodology to measure  and report on our contribution to the community. The  Business for Societal Impact has verified that our  evaluation of our community investment contributions  is correct.

These six focus areas were  identified through our materiality process conducted in 2020. We have committed to five-year sustainability targets within each focus area: Climate Action  Support and enable the transition  across our value chain towards a  net-zero emissions world and building  adaptation and resilience to the  increasing effects of climate change. Sustainable Innovation Help innovators address the most  pressing social and environmental  challenges through the power of  technology. Digital Enablement Empowering vulnerable and  disadvantaged Australians to  achieve, thrive and belong in the  digital world. Equity and Inclusion  Empower Australians of all ages,  backgrounds, gender, beliefs and  abilities to reach their potential.  Circular Economy From supply chain and product  packaging to general day-to-day  waste from our operations, there are  many opportunities to reduce the use  of resources and turn what may have  once been rubbish, into resource. Future of Work  Build knowledge and skills for  people to thrive in an ever-changing  digital world.  Our sustainability strategy We’re refining our sustainability framework  and strategy beyond FY25. This gives us a  meaningful opportunity to ensure our future  focus is on the sustainability issues that matter  most to our business and our stakeholders.   In FY24, we initiated an assessment to identify  our material sustainability-related risks and  opportunities. The assessment viewed our  potential material sustainability topics through  a dual lens: both how our business impacts  sustainability topics, and how sustainability  topics impact our business, and the financial  materiality of these impacts. The insights from this assessment will inform  and guide us as we refine and refresh our  sustainability strategy beyond FY25. We will  share an update on our new sustainability  strategy and targets in our FY25 annual  sustainability report.

We strive to adhere to the highest standards of  personal and corporate integrity, outlined in our   Code of Conduct. We expect our people to embody  these principles in their actions and decision  making and to conduct themselves in line with our  organisational values.  In line with our Code of Conduct, we must comply  with all laws, regulations, codes of practice, and  legal, regulatory and licensing requirements, including  directions and orders of any government or statutory  or regulatory authority in the areas in which we  operate. This includes tax regulations in Australia. Our  Code of Conduct aligns with our Anti-Bribery and  Corruption, Fraud Investigation and Whistleblowing  policies, which are Singtel Group-wide policies. How sustainability is governed Optus is guided by Singtel Group’s sustainability  governance approach, which includes the management  of ESG sustainability governance and key performance  indicators (KPIs). The Singtel Board provides oversight  to the Group, along with the Management Committee  and Risk Management Committee, on material ESG  topics. The Group CEO provides the Board with regular  updates on various sustainability programs, upcoming  activities, and updates on global trends that have an  impact on our sustainability strategy. During the year,  Singtel Group revised the terms of reference of the  Board Risk Committee. Now known as the Risk and  Sustainability Committee (RSC), it assists the Board  in providing oversight of Singtel Group’s sustainability,  including climate, strategy, targets, programs and  performance, in addition to risk matters. For more  information, please refer to the Singtel Group  Sustainability Report.  At Optus, the Singtel Optus Pty Limited (SOPL)  Board and Executive Leadership have responsibility  for overseeing our ESG strategy and monitoring our  performance. This year, Optus also introduced an ESG  Steering Committee, made up of representatives from  our executive team with the delegation to govern,  endorse and approve on strategies and progress  relating to our material ESG topics. We also have a  range of advisory and active ESG working groups to  ensure continued progress against our sustainability  strategy and targets.  Management of ESG KPIs We recognise the key role that management plays  to ensure the success of ESG initiatives and that our  targets are met. As such, Optus as part of the Singtel  Group, has linked collective and common ESG targets  to KPIs and incentive plans of our top executives.   This helps us to advance the sustainability agenda   and foster greater accountability and ownership  across the company. •	 20% of our Top Executive’s long-term incentive  plan remuneration is tied to specific, time bound  KPIs, such as reaching 32% of female employees in  management by FY2025. •	 ESG targets for our Management Committee’s  short-term incentive plans represent 10% of their  annual balance scorecard performance. •	 The Management Committee’s KPIs are cascaded  down to their business units, departments and  employees, whose performance bonus and other  incentives are tied to their KPIs. These targets cover key sustainability themes,  however, the focus and weighting may vary for each  executive given their different levels of influence  and impact on these ESG KPIs. For example, energy  efficiency and decarbonisation targets carry more  weighting for management members with an energy  intensive function or a stronger role in influencing the  company’s decarbonisation strategy. For more information, please refer to the   Singtel Group Sustainability Report. Sustainability governance 15 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Tax transparency  As a leading Australian technology and  telecommunications company, we recognise the vital  role that our tax contributions play in supporting public  finances and the social programs they fund. We are  committed to a high standard of tax governance and  compliance with applicable tax laws of the jurisdictions  where we operate. We acknowledge the need for sensible and  useful disclosure of tax information and that tax  transparency improves the community’s confidence  in the corporate sector. As a signatory to the Board  of Taxation’s voluntary tax transparency code, we  continue to publish Tax Transparency Reports and  have done so since FY18. You can find out more about  our approach to tax and our latest Tax Transparency  Report on our website. You can also view more  details about our Tax practices in the Singtel Group  Sustainability Report. Security, data privacy and whistleblowing Our Privacy Policy outlines our strict procedures  that govern the handling and protection of sensitive  customer information. We value the privacy of our  customers and their data, which is stored within our  networks and systems and we know that it is critical  that we make digital experiences safer. We have  safeguards and controls in place for the protection  of customer data including Call Stop, ScamWise and  Digital ID.  We continue to record customer privacy complaints  that are referred to us by our customers, staff, other  individuals or regulatory bodies. In FY24, we recorded  121 privacy related complaints. Of these, 17 cases  were referred by the Telecommunications Industry  Ombudsman (TIO). All complaints are thoroughly  investigated and where substantiated are remediated.  In all cases we engage directly with the customer to  understand and address substantiated complaints by  providing appropriate solutions for those individuals,  and where relevant provide information on how to  protect themselves online. We also take action to  understand and address underlying causes, including  reviewing policies and procedures, implementing  additional controls and through providing coaching  and training to our people to ensure processes are  understood and followed properly.  On one occasion we met the threshold to notify the  Office of the Australian Information Commissioner  (OAIC) in relation to a limited number of unauthorised  accesses to undertake fraudulent SIM card swaps. In  this case, Optus reversed the unauthorised SIM card  swaps, took steps to secure the affected accounts  and notified affected individuals and the OAIC. We  are reviewing further steps we can take to protect  customers from unauthorised SIM card swaps and  password resets.  In FY24, we received 70 whistleblower complaints, with  13 cases being substantiated, 38 not substantiated  and 19 carried forward at 31 March 2024. It is an  increase from the preceding years, with 41 and 62  complaints received in FY23 and FY22 respectively.   Of the 14 cases brought forward at the end of FY23,   11 were substantiated and three not substantiated.  16 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Regulatory requirements   and self-reporting This year there were two instances where we  unfortunately did not meet the expectations of our  people and our customers.   In February 2024, Optus RetailCo Pty Ltd entered  into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair  Work Ombudsman (FWO) after it self-reported  to the FWO that a number of current and former  employees had received incorrect payments  and entitlements. The terms of the EU include a  contrition payment of $450,000 (paid in February  2024), an independent audit, additional compliance  training, and a commitment to improved payroll  systems and processes. Optus RetailCo Pty Ltd  has calculated the underpayments owed to current  and former employees and has made every effort  to ensure all entitlements have been or are in the  process of being corrected and paid with interest. In March 2024, the Australian Communications  and Media Authority (ACMA) announced that  it had found Optus Mobile Pty Ltd in breach of  its obligation to provide customer records to  the Integrated Public Number Database (IPND).  The enforcement action taken by ACMA against  Optus included an infringement notice penalty of  $1,501,500, a Direction to Comply with the IPND  rules, and a two-year Enforceable Undertaking which  includes obligations such as an external audit,   and six-monthly reporting to the ACMA. 17 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Keeping Australians   connected  ===== PAGE 19 ===== As a leading telecommunications  company, Optus has a significant  responsibility to keep our customers  and the wider community connected.  We remain committed to enhancing the  customer connectivity experience while  also maintaining existing partnerships  and forging new ones to develop  future ways of connecting people and  communities. Learnings from the network outage  The network outage in November 2023 was  challenging for our customers and for our business.  We are very sorry that we fell short of delivering  the services the community and our customers  expect. We have taken decisive action since the  outage to ensure we provide seamless connectivity  for our customers. This includes conducting several  comprehensive technical reviews of systems and  processes alongside several global suppliers and  reconfiguring key equipment and protocols to prevent  a similar event happening again. Connecting  Australia  Highlights this year 5G National   Population Coverage 80.5% Over 4,200 5G sites 19 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Keeping Australians connected  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Expanding our coverage  with SpaceX’s Starlink Optus, in collaboration with SpaceX, which  designs, manufactures and launches some  of the world’s most advanced rockets and  spacecraft, announced an agreement in June  2023 to deliver mobile connectivity using  SpaceX’s Starlink satellite constellation.  Through this agreement, we will work to  expand the reach of customers’ mobile  connectivity to include the 60% of Australia’s  land mass* that currently has no mobile  coverage. This will be achieved through  a phased rollout of Starlink’s satellite  capability, starting with SMS in late 2024,  with voice and data to follow in late 2025.   The service will complement our existing  mobile networks, allowing customers to  connect to the SpaceX Low Earth Orbit  satellite-based network from their mobile  phone when outside the coverage area of   our terrestrial mobile network.  *Excludes Australian Radio Quiet Zone in Western Australia  where no service is permitted to be provided and Remote  Offshore Territories and Islands of Australia. Coverage  requires a clear line of sight to most of the sky. 20 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Keeping Australians connected  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Climate action Supporting and enabling the transition  towards a net-zero emissions world.  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Climate change is one of the most pressing global  issues of our time, with the effects of a warming  planet already being felt in many communities across  Australia. We know that we have an important role  to play in taking action towards achieving a net-zero  emissions world and building climate adaptation and  resilience in our network to combat the increasing  effects of climate change. To provide over 11 million telecommunications and  technology services across Australia every day, we  rely on a range of natural resources, including energy,  water, metals and minerals, and land. We understand  the impact this has on climate and nature, and we’re  continuing to take steps to reduce that impact and  helping our customers, communities and suppliers to  do the same.  This year, we continued working on energy efficiency  initiatives across our infrastructure, increased the  deployment of onsite and offsite renewable electricity  to power our operations and expanded the number  of hybrid vehicles in our fleet. We’ve also continued  to take additional steps to better manage the  environmental impact of our supply chain, and we’re  putting a greater emphasis on this going forward  following the development of our sustainable  procurement guidelines and roadmap.  We also know that our services will need to be  increasingly resilient to the effects of global warming.  Some parts of Australia are already experiencing an  increased frequency and severity of storms, floods,  cyclones, heatwaves, droughts or bushfires. So, we’ve  continued to focus on improving our adaptation and  resilience to a changing climate, including through  a focus on improving our emergency response  technology and collaborating with partners, such  as the CSIRO and Australian National University, on  strategies to mitigate the risk of bushfires.  Climate action  Highlights this year Updated our Singtel Group  commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse  gas emissions across our Singapore and Australian operations   by 2045 (brought forward from 2050) Achieved energy efficiency  improvements estimated at 16.1 Gigawatt hours  per annum Increased the use of renewable  electricity across our operations  from 25.37%   to 27.50%  of our total consumption when mandatory   large-scale generation certificates (LGCs)   are included (6.7% to 8.5% when mandatory   LGCs are excluded) Increased the number of   hybrid vehicles in our fleet to up from 94   last year 119   Contracted an initial  23% renewable  energy mix  above mandatory requirements   for years 2025–2029 22 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 23 =====   Progress against our 2025 targets Target	 Reduce by 25% absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emissions (tCO2e) FY25 Targets We will be resetting our environmental strategy targets to align  with the Singtel Group’s renewed SBTi-validated targets. For more  information, please refer to the Singtel Group Sustainability Report.  Progress In 2021, we set a goal to transition 100% of our electricity requirements  to be backed by renewable resources by the end of 2025. However, due  to volatility of the energy markets over the past few years, combined  with various market and operating challenges, this ambition has been  challenging to achieve. We have therefore removed this goal from our  sustainability strategy and will instead focus on reducing our Scope 1  and Scope 2 emissions by no less than an additional 55% between 2023  and 2030 in line with Group targets.  Progress Reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 4.3% (location- based) and 9.7% (market-based). As part of our sustainability-linked loan, Optus has a target   to achieve a 25% reduction in its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions (market-based) by FY25, from its FY15 baseline.   More information on our sustainable financing is   available on page 28.

This standalone  report includes details on the Singtel Group’s climate  scenario analysis, adaptation and mitigation plans  for operations in Singapore and Australia. For more  information, please refer to the Singtel Group’s latest  TCFD report.  The Singtel Group’s commitment   to achieve net zero by 2045 This year, the Singtel Group, including Optus, renewed  its emissions reduction targets to align with the goals  of the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit  global warming to 1.5°C. This raises the Singtel Group’s  level of ambition from its previous Science Based  Targets, which were aligned with a well below 2°C  pathway.  The Singtel Group has an updated commitment to  achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  by 2045. This requires a reduction of at least 90% in  absolute Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions from  an FY23 base year. Any hard to abate emissions may  be neutralised through the permanent removal and  storage of carbon from the atmosphere after the 90%  reduction target has been achieved. Achieving this ambitious goal will require deep and  meaningful emissions reductions across the value  chain. To enable this, Optus will continue collaborating  with our suppliers, customers and other value chain  partners on decarbonisation opportunities. Optus has  developed initiatives that drive energy efficiencies and  increase the use of renewable electricity. The Singtel Group which includes Optus, had its first emissions reduction targets  validated by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) in 2017. It included a commitment  to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 42% and Scope 3 emissions by 30% across  Singapore and Australian operations by FY30, from a FY15 base year. In December 2023, the Singtel Group’s renewed emissions reduction targets, which are  aligned with a 1.5°C pathway, were independently validated by the SBTi. Renewed emissions reduction targets The Singtel Group has also committed  to the following long-term targets:  Reduce absolute Scope 1,   Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions by  90%  by FY45 from an FY23 base year Reduce absolute Scope 3   GHG emissions from purchased goods   and services, capital goods, use of sold products,  downstream leased assets, and investments by   40%  by FY30 from an FY23 base year The Singtel Group, including Optus, has  committed to the following near-term targets: Reduce absolute Scope 1   and Scope 2 GHG emissions   by an additional  55%  by FY30 from an FY23 base year 24 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Scope 1 FY24 (tCO2e) FY23 (tCO2e) FY22 (tCO2e) Total Scope 1 emissions 1,741 1,591 1,579 Fugitive emissions (refrigerants)  258.1 48 195 Fuel combustion (stationary) 486.5 487 286 Fuel combustion (mobile) 996.7 1,056 1,098 Scope 2       Electricity (location-based) 350,491 366,357 425,015 Electricity (market-based) 308,331 341,792 392,674 Scope 3 Total Scope 3 emissions 808,328 1,635,165 4,209,290 Category 1: Purchased goods and services  224,905 788,700 2,397,584 Category 2: Capital goods  171,442 346,726 1,193,179 Category 3: Fuel and energy related services  38,337 40,605 43,007 Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution 3,518 4,149 5,690 Category 5: Waste generated in operations  774 258 189 Category 6: Business travel  4,033 4,702 581 Category 7: Employee commute  774 5,103 3,011 Category 8: Upstream leased assets  N/A N/A N/A Category 9: Downstream transportation and distribution  N/A N/A N/A Category 10: Processing of sold products N/A N/A N/A Category 11: Use of sold products 361,515 442,040 562,523 Category 12: End-of-life treatment of sold products 593 697 1,027 Category 13: Downstream leased assets N/A N/A N/A Category 14: Franchises  2,478 2,185 2,499 Category 15: Investments N/A N/A N/A In FY23, only 85% of spend was included in Scope 3, categories 1 and 2. This has been restated in FY24 to include 100% of spend, using an assumed industry  specific emissions factor for the remaining 15% spend. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions Optus’ main sources of Scope 1 (direct) emissions  include emissions from stationary diesel for back- up generators and transport fuel from our fleet,  with an additional contribution from refrigerant  gases. Scope 2 (indirect) emissions are those  associated with our electricity use and make up the  bulk of our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions (not  included in Scope 2) that occur in our value chain  and make up more than 70% of Optus’ overall  emissions profile. We recognise that there are  a range of challenges related to measuring and  reducing Scope 3 emissions, including our reliance  on suppliers for relevant information, gaps in data,  issues with data quality and our ability to influence  suppliers’ operational and commercial practices.  These are not challenges we can solve on our own,  and we continue to work with our suppliers and  partners to reduce our Scope 3 emissions. Optus has been disclosing our Scope 3 emissions  since FY22, and in FY24, we continue to make  improvements to our calculation methodologies  and data collection. We report against the majority  of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 3 categories  as set out in the table on the right. The reduction on our Scope 3, Categories 1  and 2 are mostly attributed to the improved  calculation methodology and emission factor  sources available. For more information about our  methodologies, please refer to our 2024 Data Pack  on our website. 25 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 26 ===== Reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions In FY24, our Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based  emissions were 310,072 tCO2e, which accounted for  27.7% of our overall emissions footprint. We achieved   a reduction of 9.7% compared to last year.  This year, we continued our focus on reducing our  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions through energy  efficiency measures, deploying onsite and offsite  renewable electricity, increasing our use of hybrid  vehicles, and exploring alternatives for our cooling and  emergency electricity generation needs. Driving energy efficiencies Decommissioning a range of legacy, redundant and  end-of-life network components, and implementation  of other energy efficiency technologies that we  estimate has enabled us to reduce our electricity  consumption by approximately 16.1 GWh (which is  equivalent to 10,476 tCO2e) annually. For example, we  deployed software across our 5G mobile network that  dynamically switches off broadcast elements when  there is no user demand for them. Decarbonising our operations 26 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 27 ===== Transitioning to renewable electricity In addition to our focus on improving energy efficiency,  we are committed to increasing our use of renewable  electricity to help us achieve our Scope 1 and Scope 2   emissions reduction targets. We acknowledge that  we are not on track to meet our previously stated  goal to source 100% renewable electricity for our  operations by the end of 2025. External factors such  as COVID-19 disruptions, fluctuations in global energy  prices and increased competition for access to clean  energy projects has led to significant price volatility  in Australia’s national energy market. And internal  factors, such as operational challenges, has meant  that we have been unable to deliver on our renewable  electricity goal in line with our original timeframe and  budget. Despite these challenges, we have continued to  take steps to increase our renewable electricity  consumption. This year, we proudly:  •	 Launched our National Solar Program to deploy  solar photovoltaic (PV) technology at five key  Optus exchanges and satellite sites, which will add  477-kilowatt (kW) peak capacity of onsite solar  in our operations. While this represents a small  amount of our electricity consumption, construction  is underway to further increase our onsite solar  capacity in the year ahead.  •	 Signed our first Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)  which will begin on 1 January 2025. When coupled  with the default renewable electricity available  from Australia’s national grid, we expect that  approximately 42% of our electricity consumption  will be backed by renewable sources.   Moving forward, our transition to renewable energy  will continue to remain part of our sustainability  strategy. Increasing our use of renewables is an  effective lever we can use to reduce our reliance on  fossil fuels and achieve our science-based Scope 1 and  Scope 2 emission reduction targets. Installing onsite  renewable capacity at key Optus sites will also be an  important way that we can improve the resilience of  our network operations if the national electricity grid is  disrupted by severe weather events.  We’ll continue to review and adjust our plans to  transition to renewable electricity on a regular basis,  and will share updates on our progress in our annual  sustainability reports. Other initiatives Added 25 hybrid vehicles to our Optus  fleet. We now have 119 hybrid vehicles   in our fleet, up from 94 hybrid vehicles in  FY23. Hybrid vehicles represent 76% of all  passenger vehicles in the Optus fleet.  We completed an engineering review  of our chillers fleet to understand the  options available to replace those  systems running on refrigerants with   high emission factors (e.g. R22, R134A). 27 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 28 ===== Sustainable financing linked to our   Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions Sustainability-linked financing is a type of loan where  the interest rate is tied to the achievement of certain  sustainability goals. This encourages companies to  invest in projects that promote sustainable growth  and development. In April 2023, Optus issued a A$100  million 5-year fixed-rate Sustainability-Linked Bond  (SLB). The SLB has been issued in accordance with the  Singtel Group Sustainability-Linked Bond framework  that was established on 14 October 2021. The interest  rate for this loan and bond issuance were linked to  Optus’ goal of achieving a 25% reduction in absolute  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by FY25, from its FY15  baseline. We are on track to achieve this target.  Another instrument of the sustainable financing  program is the rollout in FY24 of our Internal Carbon  Pricing (ICP) program. This puts a price of carbon  (currently averaged at A$70/tCO2e) on emissions  intensive projects and technology so that the business  makes the right long-term decisions that help lower  both embedded and operational emissions. The ICP  is complemented by Singtel Group’s ‘Green Fund’  that further supports the decarbonisation of our  operations including the upgrade of technology across  our networks, the deployment of onsite solar PV  system in our exchanges and the decommissioning of  legacy infrastructure. Case study: Installing onsite rooftop   solar technology across our network  In FY24, with the financial support of over A$5  million from the Singtel Group's GreenFund, we  launched our national solar program to begin  installing onsite rooftop solar at key sites. Onsite  solar generation is a cost-effective, low-carbon  solution that supports our resilience to energy  market disruptions caused by factors such as  extreme weather events, power outages, energy  policy, and broader supply chain disruptions. We installed 477-kilowatt (kW) capacity of rooftop  solar at five key Optus exchanges and satellite sites  across Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and  Western Australia which are expected to generate  696,420 kilowatt hours (kWh) annually. While  this represents a small amount of our electricity  consumption in FY24, we will continue to roll-out  approximately 3,561-kilowatt (kW) capacity of solar  PV to 16 additional sites in FY25.  “Singtel’s GreenFund investment  has helped us take important steps  forward in creating additional solar  capacity in the market and improve  Optus’ energy independence as we  move towards a more sustainable  and reliable energy future.”  Martin Lamprecht   Vice President of Optus Network   Deployment and Infrastructure 28 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 29 ===== Case Study: Signing our first Power   Purchase Agreement (PPA) for offsite  renewable electricity In May 2023, we signed our first Renewable  Energy PPA with Snowy Hydro’s Red Energy,  which will supply Optus with a mix of solar, wind  and hydroelectricity from 1 January 2025. PPAs  are long-term agreements between renewable  electricity generators and businesses for  purchasing electricity. They are an important and  strategic focus for Optus as we increase the use of  renewable electricity for our network operations. PPAs can reduce our exposure to price volatility  in the electricity market, which is crucial during  supply chain, geographical or market disruptions.  PPAs also signal demand for renewables, which  can encourage the development of new renewable  projects. Optus is proud to be signalling this  commitment in the market as one of the largest  telecommunications companies in Australia. Optus’ PPA is expected to deliver 635GWh of  renewable electricity from 1 January 2025 to  31 December 2029, which will increase the share of  electricity from renewable sources to 42% in CY25  when mandatory LGCs are included (23% in CY25  when mandatory LGCs are excluded).   We will continue to explore additional PPAs in the  coming years, as well as consider other renewable  sourcing strategies, to support our ongoing  transition to renewable electricity. Snowy Hydro, Tumut NSW 29 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Reducing our Scope 3 emissions Scope 3 emissions are emissions that occur outside Optus’  direct operations – such as from our supply chain or from  customers using our products. As such, it represents  the majority of Optus’ emissions footprint. Optus is  committed to collaborating with key suppliers to reduce  the emissions in our supply chain, and we also encourage  our customers to do the same.  This year, we focused on improving our Scope 3   emissions by:  •	 Improving our data collection and calculation  methodologies for Category 1: Purchased goods and  services emissions. This involved product-specific  emission factors which provides a more accurate  estimate of actual emissions generated.  •	 Commencing the introduction of internal carbon pricing  in our Procurement processes by applying a shadow  average carbon price of A$70 in selected relevant  tenders. This supports the calculation of our Holistic  Cost of Ownership (HCO) alongside the Total Cost of  Ownership (TCO) to compare the submissions from the  vendors. For example, in a recent electronic equipment  tender we requested specific product carbon footprint  (PCF) information for the products offered by the  vendors to calculate the HCO of each of those products.  •	 Collaborating with our suppliers through the Carbon  Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain Program. This  program has helped us to engage with some of our  most important suppliers to manage environmental  risks and impacts within Optus’ supply chain. Data  collected includes details of our suppliers’ emissions   and plans to reduce them as well as climate related   risks and opportunities. 30 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Optus Eco We continue to offer our consumer customers  Optus Eco, which enables them to reduce the  environmental impact of their mobile phone  service. Launched in March 2022, Optus Eco  allows customers, via the My Optus app to:  •	Choose to receive their bills and  invoices online to reduce paper waste  and carbon emissions.  •	Connect to a plastic-free digital eSIM  to reduce plastic usage and waste.  •	Offset some of their mobile phone’s  carbon emissions by supporting  Australian carbon reduction projects.  Together with our partner Green Collar, our  customers can support local offset projects  that have meaningful impact on the Australian  environment and adhere to the government’s  Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU)  accreditation standards.  In FY24, over 13,900 customers joined Optus  Eco resulting in 997 tCO2e in emissions offset  through the surrender of ACCUs. Since the  program was launched, over 21,000 customers  have taken part in the program, with over 1,520  tCO2e in emissions offset.

Earlier climate  change risk assessments undertaken in 2015, 2020  and 2021 have informed our network adaptation and  resilience initiatives to ensure we continue supporting  our communities and emergency service providers  to stay connected during times of crisis. For more  information, please refer to the Singtel Group’s  latest TCFD report. This year, we improved our disaster response   planning by:  •	 Continuing our collaboration with the CSIRO,  Australia’s national science agency, to mitigate  bushfire risks to telecommunications infrastructure  by applying CSIRO research on local bushfire  weather, fuel load, vegetation and topography to  identify telecommunications base stations that  are at greatest risk to the impacts of embers,  radiation and flames. This has been further  advanced with the Australian Government funded  CSIRO Telecommunications resilience investment  pilot that aims to develop enhanced approaches to  reduce the risk and build resilience to bushfires and  floods in the telecommunications sector. Optus will  be a key participant contributing to the CSIRO’s  research. •	 Continuing our collaboration with the Australian  National University to develop the Bushfire  Research Centre of Excellence, which shares  insights related to the early evolution of bushfire  ignitions, evaluates fire direction techniques  to inform early detection, and demonstrates  technology that can control and suppress bushfire  ignitions in deep bushland, and more. •	 Collaborating with the Department of Fire &  Emergency Services in Western Australia to  support the state’s response to extensive power  outages following two severe thunderstorms  in January 2024, which directly affected more  than 50 Optus mobile sites between Perth and  Kalgoorlie. The Optus incident management  team deployed a SATCAT unit to Narrogin, which  was one of four key sites impacted, as well as  portable generators and Optus field operations  professions to support communities and keep  them connected. The SATCAT was deployed for  three days serving the community.  Improving our climate   resilience and adaptation Natural disasters and   extreme weather Telecommunications and technology  services are vital to keep our communities  safe, informed and connected, especially  during times of emergency or disaster.  We understand that our role as one of the  largest telecommunications providers in  Australia means that Australians rely on  our services to keep businesses running and  people connected in their time of need.  Over the last year, Australia has experienced  natural disasters and extreme weather  events which have caused damage and  disruption to Australians and tested our  individual and collective resilience.  We have invested approximately   A$8.8 million this year into a range   of government-funded adaptation   initiatives in our network. 32 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Being prepared for natural disasters enables  Optus to minimise the connectivity disruptions  for customers and communities and enable an  efficient and effective response to restore services  when and where it is needed. On 13 December  2023, Tropical Cyclone Jasper passed through Far  North Queensland, leaving communities in areas  such as Mossman, Cairns and Tully without power  and facing flooding due to widespread heavy rain.  Preparations by Optus Field Operations in  the days prior had seen the shift of portable  generators from Brisbane to Townsville for  staging. This included four trailer generators  capable of supporting larger sites for extended  periods. Exercises to monitor fuel levels in fixed  generators already onsite at key locations  identified opportunities to pre-plan fuel drops and  ensure tanks were at capacity and facilitated long  run times on sites where critical infrastructure and  transmission are located. More than 12 portable  generators were utilised interchangeably based on  priorities and progress with utility power status.  The Far North Queensland SATCAT (trailer-based  mobile base station using satellite transmission  backhaul) was also staged in Cairns with an  upgraded radio ready to deploy in any suitable  circumstances if identified. Unfortunately access  to the worst hit regions like Mossman was cut off  to all vehicles which did not allow deployment of  the SATCAT in this instance. By the time access  was available, a portable trailer generator was  used to restore the Mossman area which also  supported the Daintree region. Following the cyclone, and in line with our disaster  response framework, Optus engaged with relevant  Queensland disaster coordination groups to  identify any site access issues for the worst hit  regions and communities, and to understand  timelines for the expected restoration of mains  power. We deployed trucks and other vehicles to  provide customers and communities with access  to devices, WiFi and Prepaid SIM cards and, for  eligible Postpaid mobile customers facing hardship,  an added 100GB of bonus data. Case Study: Keeping people connected through Cyclone Jasper “I am proud of our ongoing  commitment to supporting the  communities affected by Tropical  Cyclone Jasper. In times of crisis, our  focus remains on connecting people,  providing vital communication  channels, and helping to ensure that  communities can stay connected,  resilient and face the challenges  ahead with optimism.” David Morrissey  Optus General Manager  for North Queensland 33 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Circular economy From supply chain and product packaging  to general day-to-day waste from our  operations, there are many opportunities   to turn what may have once been rubbish,  into resource.  ===== PAGE 35 ===== We know that the traditional linear  ‘take-make-dispose’ economic model  is unsustainable over the longer term  as it relies on the consumption of finite  resources. We can have a positive impact  by shifting to a circular economy model  that is restorative and regenerative  by design, designing-out waste and  pollution, keeping products and materials  in use for longer, and contributing to the  regeneration of nature. The technology and telecommunications products and  services we provide our customers rely on a range of  natural resources including metals, minerals, water,  energy and land. From the raw materials used in  equipment manufacturing, to the way we package and  distribute products, and what we do when our products  are no longer needed – we understand that our value  chain impacts on climate and nature.  This year, we continued to focus on working with trusted  and ethical suppliers to identify opportunities to design- out single-use materials and packaging in our Optus- branded products. We continued our efforts to reduce  our waste sent to landfill by using smart bins, introducing  new waste solutions, educating our people to inspire  behavioural change, and improving recycling of our  e-waste and network infrastructure. We also continued  providing options to support our customers to reuse and  recycle their devices in our stores. Circular economy  Highlights this year Recycled or reused  97.8% of e-waste  from our operations including   network* sites, corporate offices   and retail stores. *Based on network waste data available in FY24. 85% of packaging from approximately 300   Optus-branded products. is recyclable, reusable   or compostable Developed  sustainable  procurement  guidelines  and supported our Optus- branded suppliers to enhance  their circularity principles.

However,  the main challenge to reach our 100% target  is phasing out the plastic holder used in our  conventional SIM cards. Using eSIMs is an  option available to our customers and could  support the achievement of our 2025 target. Progress In FY24, we achieved 61%, which does not  put us on track to achieve our target.

We  take a holistic approach to our product stewardship  responsibilities, which considers our upstream and  downstream impacts across our value chain:   •	 Upstream – how we select and collaborate with  ethically, environmentally and socially responsible  suppliers, and how we bring to life our focus on the  effective use of resources.  •	 Operations – reducing the impacts of our products,  their associated packaging, and of our corporate,  retail and network operations.  •	 Downstream – seeking opportunities to reuse or  recycle our products to extend their useful life and  protect the value of natural resources.     Our commitment to product stewardship To support our commitment to product  stewardship, we have set three targets   to achieve by 2025. Our focus on environmentally   sustainable supply chains This year, our Sustainability team collaborated with  different teams across the organisation to enhance  our environmental supply chain practices. We achieved  this by looking at the supplier’s full life cycle including:  •	 Improving and simplifying our supplier questionnaire  to collect information from new vendors  participating in tenders so we can assess their  current and future environmental performance.  Building the knowledge and capabilities of our  teams through information sharing sessions about  packaging and alignment to the Australian 2025  Packaging Targets.  •	 Developing Circular Economy roadmaps for the  Retail, Networks and Corporate sites, which will  identify actions to be taken to enhance our resource  management performance.  •	 Ensuring contracts with new suppliers consider  the ‘end-of-life’ stage for the networks’ equipment  we buy so we can think ahead about how to  manage them when they are due for an upgrade/ replacement.  Our combined efforts show our commitment to  improving our environmental supply chain practices  and contributing to a circular economy in partnership  with our valued suppliers.  We have developed circular economy roadmaps for our  products (including for SIMs, modems, and mobiles),  our retail and marketing activities, and our networks  and corporate facilities, with specific actions to help  us achieve our three targets. Our roadmaps take a life  cycle view of the environmental impact of our products  before they reach our stores, during their usage, and  after their useful life. In FY24, we continued to make  progress towards the achievement of these targets,  but we still have more to do. 90% of our e-waste   reused and recycled 100% recyclable, reusable  or compostable packaging 90% waste diversion   from landfill 37 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Circular economy  ===== PAGE 38 ===== Reuse and Recycling e-waste Repurposing and recycling devices Repurposing previously loved devices is one of the best  ways that we can reduce landfill. Throughout FY24 we  continued to support the industry wide MobileMuster  initiative to encourage our customers to recycle their  devices including mobile phones, modems, smart  watches, smart home devices and gaming consoles.  Customers can recycle their old devices in-store, or via  reply-paid recycling satchels in Optus’ Prepaid mobile  bundles. Up to 99.3% of the materials in these devices  are recovered through our partners in our supply chain. In FY24, we received approximately 37,830 devices for  recycling, which accounted for approximately 19.5*  tonnes of mineral resources conserved. Recycling the materials from   our network sites In FY24, we continued to achieve our target of  recycling 95% of our network waste. We work closely  with our industry partners and customers to recover  technology and other e-waste for reuse and recycling.  As we upgrade our network, we identify recycled and  reuse opportunities for legacy technology, and work  with suppliers to extend the life of network technology.  In FY24, we diverted 509 tonnes of network equipment  from landfill.   *Approximate savings figure obtained from the MobileMuster  calculator using mobile devices as a proxy – noting that the  device number also includes modems, landlines and tablets  which may have used more or less mineral resources. Ensuring our packaging is recoverable We report annually to the Australian Packaging  Covenant Organisation (APCO), which includes  disclosures against the criteria of the Packaging  Sustainability Framework, such as design and  procurement, recycled content, recoverability,   disposal labelling and waste.  We also support the implementation of the  Australasian Recycling Label (ARL) in our products,  which requires clear labelling on how customers can  recycle our products, to continue improving kerbside  recovery in Australia. During FY24, we continued implementing the actions  identified in our Circular Economy Roadmap for  Packaging developed in FY22. For example, we  progressed:  •	 Our new generation of 5G modems are made  primarily from 95% recycled plastic, its packaging  has no single-use plastic and it is fully recyclable in  kerbside recycling across Australia.  •	 Reducing the number of plastic pillows used in  packaging our shipments to customers by replacing  them with paper-based alternatives. Our Circular Economy Roadmaps, which we continued  to implement in FY24, highlights opportunities to  reduce waste and provides actions across our supply  chain to minimise the amount of single-use packaging  and non-recyclable packaging used in Optus products. 38 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Circular economy  ===== PAGE 39 ===== In February 2024, we celebrated the  launch of our new Ultra WiFi 5G Modem.  This is our second modem made from at  least 95% recycled plastic (excluding the  electronic components in the modem  and the screen). The modem’s packaging  has no single-use plastic and is 100%  recyclable in general kerbside recycling  across Australia.   We worked closely with our suppliers  to find solutions to reduce the  environmental impact of our new  5G modems. This engagement with  our suppliers has strengthened our  relationships and we are optimistic about  identifying further opportunities for  collaboration and shared impact.  The new 5G modems also have ‘quick  start’ guides that encourage customers  to bring their old modems into any of our  Optus stores for recycling. Reducing waste generated   by our operations We have six waste streams across our corporate  offices: comingled recycling, organics, paper and  cardboard, e-waste, specialty waste and general  waste.  We continue to use outdoor smart bins at our  Optus Campus Sydney, which eliminate recycling  contamination, and improved how we manage  organic food waste at our Sydney campus (refer to  page 54 for Charopy smart bin case study for more  information). We transitioned away from using food  digesters which sends food waste through sewerage  networks, and instead have engaged a vendor that  uses anaerobic digestion technology which converts  food waste into a combustible gas, which can be  used as a fuel source to produce green electricity.  In FY24, we also had a strong focus on employee  awareness and engagement campaigns to improve  behaviours around waste and recycling. This included  a major national digital campaign, which included our  Optus Ambassador, Ian Thorpe, to create awareness  and improve our recycling behaviours.  Case Study: Our new 5G modem made from 95% recycled plastic “We listen to our customers and know  that many of them are increasingly  looking for more sustainable products.

Issues  such as cybersecurity and scamming  threats, cyberbullying, and image-based  abuse continue to grow and deepen,  particularly through the impact of  artificial intelligence (AI) and generative  AI. Despite these issues, we know that  technology can play a significant role  in bridging the digital divide and enable  connectivity.  Our digital enablement strategy is two-pronged. We  are committed to helping equip Australians to be safe  and resilient online citizens, as well as helping bridge  the digital divide so that everyone can achieve, thrive  and belong in today’s digital world. Digital inclusion  is about affordability, access and the ability to use  technology, and while there have been improvements  in Australia’s digital inclusion, some groups of people  remain excluded. These include the one in eight adults,  and one in six Australian children living in poverty.  During FY24 through our flagship programs, Digital  Thumbprint and Donate Your Data™ and long-term  partnerships with not-for-profit organisations and  government, we continued to foster an inclusive  society where no-one is left behind when it comes to  connectivity and encourage positive and respectful  relationships online.

In FY24, we introduced a range of new  interactive online materials to support  parents, young people and children as they  connect online. New materials include: •	 First Phone quiz and guide to help parents  start conversations about key milestones  like a child’s first phone. Our interactive  quiz evaluates the child’s digital safety  and wellbeing awareness, providing  parents with a personalised readiness  score for their child. •	 Cyberbullying quiz and guide to empower  children to be an upstander (someone  who chooses to support a person who is  being abused or harmed) when it comes  to cyberbullying and learn what to do  about it when they see this occur. •	 Hackers, scammers and fake friends   quiz and guide to teach children that not  everybody is who they claim to be online  and to help them stay safe online. A full list of program resources can be found  on our website digitalthumbprint.com.au Digital Thumbprint   workshops for schools Through facilitator-led and teacher-led digital  interactive workshops, the Digital Thumbprint  program teaches primary and high school students  core principles around online safety and wellbeing, and  encourages positive online behaviour around privacy,  security and responsible technology use.  In FY24, 60,592 students took part in a free Digital  Thumbprint workshop. This takes our total student  participation to 620,468 exceeding our target of  reaching 550,000 students by FY25. Educating young  people and their families about digital safety is one  of our key areas of focus and we’re proud that these  results reinforce this commitment. With hackers and scammers increasingly targeting  children via game chat and social media, we launched a  new workshop – Protecting Your Personal Information  – to help students understand what personal  information is, and the actions to take to protect  themselves from identity theft and scams. Since  launching, 10,351 students have completed the new  workshops. 45 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Digital enablement Thumbprint Optus Digital Supporting digital safety and wellbeing   ===== PAGE 46 ===== Measuring the Digital Thumbprint   program’s impact In FY24, we engaged an independent expert  to evaluate the Digital Thumbprint program’s  impact on student attitudes and behavioural  change on digital safety and wellbeing. Over  2,300 students participated in the research,  and we are proud that the results show that  the program is having a positive impact on  changing student behaviours:  Digital Thumbprint program’s impact on students: 92% of primary students who completed the  Cyberbullying and Respectful Relationships  Online and Protecting Your Personal  Information Online workshops have more ideas  about where to go for help to stay safe online. After completing the facilitator-led  Cyberbullying and Respectful Relationships  Online workshop, 94% of secondary students  said they will try to use social media in a more  positive way. Eight out of 10 secondary students surveyed  have more ideas about where to go for help  to stay safe online after completing Digital  Thumbprint workshops online. “Before the Digital Thumbprint  workshop I didn’t care as  much about others online.   I was just on there to use it  and have entertainment.

Our aim is to help bridge the digital  divide by enabling free connectivity to up to 100,000  disadvantaged youth and families by 2025. We  launched our Donate Your Data™ program in 2019 to  support Australians who don’t have or cannot afford  regular access to the internet.  In collaboration with our long-term charity partners  like The Smith Family, Good360 Australia, and KARI  Foundation, we provide free calls, text and data  to young people, families and other Australians,  facilitating their access to essential services,  education, job opportunities and social connection. We  also provide free connectivity during times of natural  disaster. It is a powerful way that Optus, together with  our customers, can support the community in ensuring  no one is left behind when it comes to digital inclusion. In FY24, Optus’ Donate Your Data program provided  over 15 million GBs of data, connecting an additional  6,335 individuals and families, donated by 204,335  unique customers. To date, over 60 million GBs of  data has been donated by 744,935 unique customers  through the Donate Your Data program since its  launch in 2019. Working with our charity partners, Optus has reached  over 45,000 Australians including young people and  their families through The Smith Family, First Nations  people across the Eastern seaboard through KARI  Foundation, and working with Good360 Australia  reached those experiencing homelessness, escaping  family and domestic violence, furthering education and  training, and a host of other needs. Bridging the digital divide Increasing digital inclusion for First Nations  people is part of Target 1, Access to  Information, under the National Agreement  on Closing the Gap. The First Nations Digital  Inclusion Plan (2023-2026), released in 2023  was informed by a range of stakeholders  including the First Nations Digital Advisory  Group. Their Initial Report to government  highlights the need for placed-based  approaches to providing digital inclusion  access to First Nations people. Through  our partnership with the KARI Foundation,  we have been providing Donate Your Data  access since 2019 and launched our placed- based program support with the KARI  Foundation in 2023. This program sees Optus  volunteers working with the KARI Foundation  at community events across New South  Wales and Queensland to help participants  activate their Donate Your Data SIMs and get  connected.

They were recently awarded an inaugural contract by the  Queensland Government to provide mental health support across the state. In addition to the grants, all start-ups received support from Singtel Group and  our associates in the form of mentorship and access to a combined customer  base of over 770 million mobile users to scale their solutions or pilot new  initiatives regionally. Our 2022 Future Maker, Charopy, which offers a smart  recycling bin solution, was granted SGD$10,000 (A$11,320) to explore piloting  their solutions for deployment at Singtel and was awarded an additional  SDG$10,000 to work with AIS start-up, GEPP, on a smart bin pilot in Thailand. 53 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Sustainable innovation  ===== PAGE 54 ===== We believe in the importance of empowering  social innovators. Through the Future Makers  program, we provide socially and environmentally  focused start-ups with mentoring, upskilling and  grant funding to help them grow and scale their  technological solutions.  In September 2023, Optus supported a 2022  Future Makers program finalist – Charopy Pty  Ltd – by piloting its solar powered smart bins on  our Sydney campus. These innovative bins, which  are equipped with in-built scanning technology,  reduce recycling contamination by determining  the suitability of items for recycling prior to their  disposal. If the item is recyclable, the lights on the  bin turn green and a recycling chute opens, which  allows the item to be disposed and recycled. If  the item is not recyclable, the lights on the bin  turn red and the chute remains closed to avoid  recycling contamination.   Since the pilot’s inception, the smart bins at our  Sydney campus have diverted 260kg of waste  from landfill. For every item recycled through  Charopy bins, Optus’ charity partner the KARI  Foundation, which champions Aboriginal culture  and achievement, receives a donation through the  NSW Government’s container deposit scheme.   For more information on the FY24 Singtel Group  Future Makers Program, read the Singtel Group  Sustainability Report.  Case Study:  Charopy smart bins on campus  “Receiving a grant from the  Future Makers Program, plus  an order for this product from  Optus, enabled us to ‘lift’ our  level of product development  and come up with a totally  new recycling bin product  for use in high profile, high  visibility public areas.   Without Optus, it is unlikely  this product would have ever   come to life.”   Martin Collings   Founder & CEO of Charopy 54 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Sustainable innovation  ===== PAGE 55 ===== Toowoomba Internet of Things (IoT)   smart water meter solution With water being one of Australia’s most precious –  and increasingly costly – resources, finding a way to  save water and detect leaks early is a shared priority  for residents and local councils.  In a major upgrade to Toowoomba Regional Council’s  water infrastructure, a smart new metering solution  from an Optus-led consortium provides a way to do  both. This Toowoomba project is the first telco-led  consortium to be awarded a contract for such an  Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) solution. To deliver this critical project, Optus partnered with  IOTA, ETS Electrical Services, GreenBe and Security  Communication Solutions Intl P/L Trading as M2M  Telecoms (M2M Telecom) on the staged deployment  of 68,000 new smart water meters for Council.  The rollout began in mid-2022 and will take four years  to complete. The deployment leverages Optus’  NB-IoT network, IOTA’s blockchain-powered IoT  devices, GreenBe’s user experience platform,  installation services from ETS Deployment Services  and more. The initial stage of the meter deployment involved  residential, industrial, and commercial volunteers from  the local community, allowing for testing and fine- tuning of the system before mass deployment.  Once completed, Council will be able to operate  the water network more efficiently and residents  will be able to monitor their own water usage more  effectively. Residents of the Toowoomba region will  be able to use a web portal or app to see their water  usage in near real-time, plus receive early notification  of any leaks – a key benefit for any home or business  owner whose first warning of a hidden leak has been  an unexpectedly large water bill. These meters will  help support their future water efficiency efforts as  they can also see from the time-based water usage  report which activities are using lots of water – from  long showers to watering the garden or even using  an inefficient washing machine. Smart Water   Meter features: •	 Residents can monitor water   usage more effectively •	 View water usage in near real time   on web portal or app  •	 Receive early notification   of any leaks   •	 Time-based water usage report –  from long showers to watering the  garden or even using an inefficient  washing machine *Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects embedded with sensors and actuators that communicate with computing systems via wired or  wireless networks – allowing the physical world to be digitally monitored or even controlled.

To achieve this goal,  our Future of Work strategy encompasses two primary streams: volunteering and upskilling our people. Highlights this year Our people continue   to upskill with  525 new Optus U  accreditations Welcomed 61   new graduates Over 1,000 people  participated in a skilled  volunteering activity Awarded 5th place   in GoodCompany’s  Best Workplaces   to Give Back  award in October 2023 Over 20 people received a micro MBA   on sustainability 57 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 58 ===== Progress against our 2025 targets Measured by the number of volunteer  positions filled. *from an FY21 baseline Target Target Harness the power of volunteering  to build the knowledge and skills   of 1,500 Optus people and  community leaders FY23 Performance FY24 Performance 518 employees 1,305 Cumulative total* 479 employees Formal future focused   skills development for   1,500 employees FY23 Performance 408 Optus people 921 Cumulative total: FY24 Performance 450 Optus people 1,371 Cumulative total* 58 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 59 ===== We are committed to creating the right place for  the best people to do their best work. We have three  Optus capability and development focus areas –  Technology, Business, and Personal Excellence – to help  our people bring their learning and skills development  opportunities into one place. Our commitment  to growing our capability is supported by our key  performance indicator for all our people to complete   12 hours of learning across the year. In 2021, we introduced Optus U to provide our amazing  people with the opportunity to grow and strengthen  their capabilities in digital and future focused skills.  Optus U is part of our strategic capability offerings  and is one of the ways we deliver engaging learning  experiences for our people to invest in their future and  grow their skills.  In FY24, 525 Optus U accreditations were attained by  our people, bringing the total number of accreditations  to 1,500 since the program’s inception. Accreditations  have been attained by our amazing people in fields  such as Customer Experience, Data and Analytics,  Intelligent Automation, Cyber Security, Finance,  Product Management, Micro MBA subjects, Manawari  Aboriginal Cultural Safety, Sustainability and  Innovation.  Every year we hold an annual Learning Fiesta to  encourage our people to challenge themselves to  invest in their own growth and career mobility. The  theme for this year was ‘own your growth’. We had a  huge line up of over 100 in-person and virtual learning  opportunities, covering topics across our three  capability focus areas.  We also launched a new initiative called Job  Architecture – a simple and transparent framework  for classifying roles and skills at Optus. Through this  program we launched a jobs and skills portal, to help  our people chart their own course and have greater  visibility of potential career pathways. We want our  amazing people to feel empowered and proficient  in their current job and feel excited to challenge  themselves and grow personally and professionally. We recognise that the needs of our business will  continue to evolve and change and during FY24 we  continued to optimise our operating model, accounting  for the reshaping of our workforce. This resulted  in a decrease in our workforce between FY23 and  FY24. During this time, we supported our people with  career transition information, which was tailored  to meet individual needs, provided access to the  Optus Employee Assistance Program and offered  retrenchment packages in circumstances where they  were unable to be redeployed.  Since launching in 2020, the Talent Ambassador  Program has continued to grow and evolve. In FY24 we  now have over 200 active Optus ambassadors. Our  mission is to develop our amazing people’s personal  brand and equip them with the skills to play a pivotal  role in attracting and retaining employees at Optus  through the hashtag #OptusLife on LinkedIn. In FY24  the program generated over two million organic views  from #OptusLife ambassador posts – the highest  engagement with the hashtag in the history of the  program. We have seen over 50,000 post reactions  and an increase of 12,000 followers of the Optus  LinkedIn page.  Developing our amazing people 59 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 60 ===== Health safety and wellbeing In September 2023, we ran a Wellbeing Week which  included a series of webinars, onsite health checks,  financial wellbeing consultations and an R U OK?  Day speaker event with almost 900 participants.  Throughout the week there were blood glucose tests,  optical, in-body and bone density scans completed,  with bowel cancer kits provided. The week culminated  in the launch of the Optus Wellbeing Community,  dedicated to continuing to elevate the tools and  benefits available to employees and their families  and challenge us all to invest more in our mental,  physical, financial and social wellbeing. In FY24 we  also refreshed our mental health eLearn to provide  our employees and leaders information, resources and  support in creating a mentally healthy workplace. During FY24 we continued to make progress in  managing our workplace injuries. We successfully  completed audits for our Rehabilitation Management  System and Case Management System with no non- compliance. We are proud to uphold our AS45001  certification, the Australian Safety Management  Standard. These standards are highly regarded  worldwide and locally for occupational safety and  health systems. Our return-to-work rate remains at  100%, and we offer voluntary rehabilitation support  to our people. Our workplace injury frequency rate was  2.2 (up from 1.5 in FY23). Our workplace fatality rate  remained at 0 in FY24, and the absenteeism rate is  0.02, which is consistent with prior years.  60 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 61 ===== Community impact $241,000  Workplace giving and   fundraising donations 284 charities that received  donations through Optus  workplace giving portal,  yes4good *Includes a combination of cash, time volunteered, in-kind donations and associated management costs   (all verified by B4SI), employee fundraising and revenue forgone on fees, products and services. 576 students  participated in ABCN  mentoring programs $31.3m  Total community  contributions* in FY24 20,752 volunteer hours  contributed Highlights this year Commitment to Service  award and Commitment to  Reconciliation award 2 KARI   Foundation  awards Awarded 5th place   in GoodCompany’s  Best Workplaces   to Give Back  award in October 2023 61 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 62 ===== KARI Foundation The Optus and KARI Foundation partnership was  established in 2018, and together we launched  scholarships for Year 10 students to provide mentoring,  financial support and workshops to help upskill young  First Nations people in digital literacy, employability  and goal setting. Since then, over 100 First Nations  youth in NSW have been supported through this  scholarship program. The partnership aligns with our  mutual community investment in First Nations youth  and focuses on increasing their future employability  skills through programs like Pathways 2 Employment,  upskilling digital literacy through a tailored Digital  Thumbprint workshop and increasing their confidence  and communication skills through various mentoring  opportunities. This year we also hosted Pathway 2 Employment  sessions with KARI Foundation to build employability  skills. Our Pathways 2 Employment program provides  disadvantaged and vulnerable students with retail and  employability skills and the confidence to find a job,  either at Optus or in the broader retail sector. We’re  pleased to report that 65% of participants now have  casual employment.  This year we were proudly recognised for our ongoing  support to the KARI Foundation at their annual  Corporate Partner Thank You event. The two awards we  received were: •	 The Commitment to Reconciliation award recognising  our work on our Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan; and  •	 The Commitment to Service award recognising the  variety of ways in which we have provided ongoing  support to the KARI Foundation in the last five years. Read more about our work with the KARI Foundation in  the case study below.  62 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 63 ===== In support of our focus on reconciliation, Optus  has had an ongoing collaboration with the KARI  Foundation since 2018. The KARI Foundation is a  not-for-profit organisation that designs and delivers  a range of programs that celebrate Aboriginal culture  and achievement.   Together, we have delivered cultural awareness  training, distributed over 2,000 free Donate Your  Data SIM cards to First Nations people, and provided  funding for a range of other sustainability initiatives,  such as in-kind donations and donations collected  from our recycling container deposit scheme at our  Sydney campus. Now in its fifth year, our partnership  continues to support the KARI Scholarship program  aimed at providing financial support, career and  employability coaching for Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander youth who are in their final years of secondary  school and living in low socio-economic areas.   In FY24, we offered fully funded scholarships to  23 students in Year 10 across three high schools in  New South Wales. The program involved a series  of workshops which focused on building digital  literacy and supporting students to prepare for  future employment. We invited special guests to  the workshops, including Optus’ Chief Inspiration  Officer, Ash Barty, to share her insights on her career,  achievements and role as an indigenous leader in  the community. Optus Ambassador and captain of  the Matildas, Steph Catley, also ran a soccer clinic  for the students and mentors as part of a focus on  collaborating in the workplace.   Over the last 12 months, 20 Optus team members  took part in this program, volunteering over 60  hours of mentoring and support to students.  All students who participated in the program  completed their Year 10 studies and began their  Higher School Certificate in Year 11.  For more information on our reconciliation efforts  please read our Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan. Case Study – KARI Scholarship Program “Being part of the KARI and  Optus scholarship program  has been an enriching  learning journey, The mentors  created a welcoming and  comfortable atmosphere  as we delved into yarns,  cultural activities, workplace  insights, digital skills and  mock interviews.” Student participant 63 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 64 ===== Workplace giving Through our yes4good workplace giving program, our  generous people donated $241,000 to 284 charities  and causes, including The Pyjama Foundation,  World Vision, Jodi Lee Foundation and ABCN. Optus  matches all employee giving through our yes4good  program (up to $300 per person, per year), taking  our total charitable giving in FY24 to $298,000.  While we have seen a decrease in total charitable  giving from last year, largely due to our workforce  reshaping, we remain committed towards investing  in our community through our in-kind support and  volunteering involvement.  Optus was a founding member of the Australian  Business and Community Network (ABCN) in  2005. The ABCN is a not-for-profit that brings  businesses and schools from low socio-economic  backgrounds together to run workplace-based  mentoring programs. This aligns with Optus’  commitment to improve opportunities for  students to reach their full potential in the future  world of work.   In FY24, 211 Optus people volunteered as mentors  with the ABCN, committing 1,036 hours to  support 576 students from 50 schools across  Australia. Optus mentors have helped students to  understand their various pathways to university,  supported them with goal setting, had discussions  on future career paths, explored financial  management and more.   In FY24, Optus mentors took part in a wide range  of programs, including:   •	 Cultural and vocational literacy programs  for students from non-English speaking  backgrounds.  •	 Career planning and upskilling programs for  regional, rural and remote students.  •	 Career planning, workplace skills and life skills  for First Nations students.  Lindsay Smith   Mentor and ABCN Taskforce Lead from  Optus’ Complex and Specialist Care Team  which supports vulnerable customers,  has been part of the ABCN programs in  South Australia for 18 years. Case Study: Mentoring for the future with the   Australian Business and Community Network “It has been a privilege to be  involved with ABCN over such  a long period. Supporting  mentoring in our schools brings  such a great sense of purpose to  all our mentors. Being a mentor  is one of the most rewarding  opportunities that I have had  with Optus, especially when you  are able to see the transition  of the students and know that  you have had influence on their  growth and development. And  I look forward to continuing to  work with ABCN to help shape  the future of our young people” 64 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 65 ===== Equity and inclusion Empowering Australians of all ages, backgrounds,  gender and abilities to reach their potential.  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Equity and inclusion Our team’s diverse backgrounds, perspectives, skills and life experiences enable us to develop meaningful  connections with our customers and communities, innovate new products and services, and make better- informed business decisions. We want to drive and demonstrate equity in all areas of our business and the  communities we interact with and service, including our supply chains.

This year we have continued to measure the  diversity of our workforce, strive for greater gender  equity, demonstrate our commitment to reconciliation  and increase our efforts to make our workplace, retail  stores and community a more inclusive and accessible  place for all. Included@Optus Through our Included@Optus program, we use a mix  of virtual reality experiences and group discussions to  help our people challenge biases and take ownership  of the role they play in creating a safe, inclusive and  respectful culture. We are proud that 65% of our  people have completed this program. Going forward,  we will be expanding the program to our Retail  Frontline and onshore Contact Centres.  Diversity census In September 2023, we conducted our first voluntary  diversity census – a survey for our people designed to  help us better understand how truly diverse we are.  We were pleased that 62% of our people participated  to volunteer information, covering a broad range of  diverse identifiers including gender, First Nations,  cultural/ethnicity, disability and neurodiversity, sexual  orientation, religious affiliations, parenting and  caring responsibilities and military/voluntary services.  The census is an important step in our journey to  understand more deeply who we are and help inform  how we can improve our employee experiences, as well  as provide a baseline from where we can continue to  measure progress. Employee networks and communities Our diversity employee networks and communities are  employee-led volunteer groups that bring together  people with shared identities and their allies. We  have eight employee networks and communities  representing women, LGBTQIA+, culture and heritage,  disability, First Nations people, young professionals,  veterans and first responders and wellbeing. With the  oversight of 15 executive sponsors, the networks have  built membership to over 3,000 people (approximately  44% of our workforce). They have celebrated and  recognised over 11 key diversity dates of significance  and have contributed to over 2,000 hours of learning  for our people. Our United network supports veterans and first  responders. In FY24 we opened a new memorial garden  at our campus in Sydney. As part of our Remembrance  Day commemorations our people made poppies and  laid a wreath at the site. United continues to build  strong community partnerships with Invictus Australia,  supporting and participating in events across FY24.  Further, we continue to provide employment pathways  and opportunities through our Gold partnership with  Soldier On, presence at Australian Defence Forces  Transition Seminars and we remain a signatory to the  Veteran Employment Commitment. Our Culture Connect network celebrates the diverse  culture and heritage of our people, and for the first  time we participated in National Refugee Week in  June 2023 by collaborating with Settlement Services  International and its start-up Ignite to help refugees  and people living with a disability start businesses  and achieve financial independence. Culture Connect  continued to celebrate and recognise Lunar New  Year, Easter, Ramadan, Eid, A Taste of Harmony and  Diwali nationally. The network focused on increasing  cross cultural leadership capability by drawing on  senior leaders lived experiences. Network members  supported our customer teams to translate policies  into a range of different languages for customers.

In FY24,  we continued to strive towards a gender balanced  leadership team, closely maintaining our 25% target,  achieving 24.4% this year. We have also increased  gender representation year on year in our graduate  program from 42% in FY23 to 58% in 2024. We also remain committed to advancing women  leaders through our Emerging Executive Women  and Executive Women sponsorship programs,  with more than 60 participants over the last two  years. These bespoke programs aim to bolster our  pipeline of women stepping up into more senior  roles and increasing their exposure and education.  Program components include skills and strength  based assessments, group workshops and webinars,  professional coaching, learning pathways, mentorship  and sponsorship. Our employee network championing  women, Elevate, continues to rapidly grow in support  of empowering and elevating women at Optus. In FY24  Elevate membership grew by 66%, exceeding 600  members.  This year we also welcomed and acknowledged the  Workplace Gender Equality Amendment (Closing  the Gender Pay Gap) Bill 2023 as a significant step  in accelerating our journey towards a more equitable  workplace. The Gender Pay Gap (GPG) is an important  indicator, pinpointing areas for improvement in our  commitment to gender equality. In 2023, we continued  to see year-on-year progress in narrowing the GPG and  remain committed to reducing the GPG. You can read  about our progress in our media statement here.   Accessibility and inclusion In 2023 we completed the Access and Inclusion Index,  delivered by the Australian Network on Disability of  which we have been a member since 2016. The Index  measures an organisation’s access and inclusion  journey and is Australia’s foremost corporate  benchmarking tool. We will use these results to help  shape our next Access and Inclusion Action Plan 2024- 2029. We have already taken some immediate steps  such as releasing accessible Optus brand guidelines  in early 2024, to ensure our communications are  accessible and inclusive to all. Additionally, efforts to  enhance accessibility in retail environments, such as  refurbishing over 30 Optus-owned retail stores, have  demonstrated our focus on exceeding accessibility  standards. We have audited all of our Optus-owned  retail stores for accessibility options such as wheelchair  access, quiet times and hearing accessibility, and these  stores are also now accredited through the Hidden  Disability Sunflower Initiative to support customers  with hidden disabilities. We are committed to promoting greater inclusion for  individuals with disabilities. We continue to support  and participate in programs such as PACE Mentoring,  WhatAbility, the Hidden Disability Sunflower initiative  and the Stepping Into Internship Program to help  our people gain a better insight and understanding  of people living with a disability. Additionally, we are  proud participants in the Disability Confident Recruiter  Program, working towards eliminating barriers in the  recruitment process and creating a more accessible  and inclusive environment for individuals with  disabilities. Commitment to Reconciliation In FY24, we proudly launched our first Reflect  Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Our RAP formalises  our commitment to reconciliation. Additionally, we  have created a governance framework to ensure that  the requirements and aspirations of our reconciliation  journey are met. This framework brings together  leaders from Optus, First Nations leaders in the  community and our Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander employees. We continue to make progress on our RAP  commitments with highlights including; the  establishment of the Yarn First Nations employee  network and allies, introducing Manawari Aboriginal  Cultural Safety training into Optus U, with over 50  graduates to date,  launching an Acknowledgement  of Country guide, deepening our investment in early  career pathways through awarding scholarships  to First Nations Macquarie University Students,  embedding changes to our procurement policies to  connect our people with Indigenous businesses and  celebrating National Reconciliation and NAIDOC  weeks. Optus’ progress was recognised by the  KARI Foundation, being awarded two awards –  the Commitment to Reconciliation award and  Commitment to Service award in December 2023. 69 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Equity and inclusion  ===== PAGE 70 ===== LGBTQIA+  In January we were awarded Bronze status in the  Australian Workplace Equity Index recognising our  impact on LGBTQIA+ inclusion in our organisational  culture. We are proud to be recognised for our efforts  to make Optus an inclusive and engaging place for  LGBTQIA+ people to feel safe and be able to bring  their true selves to work. We have updated key policies,  terminology and standards with inclusive language and  benefits and developed inclusive dress code guidelines  for our frontline team. Our Express Yourself Network   is running strong in its third year and continues to bring  together people to foster a more diverse and inclusive  work environment. We are proud of our role as a major partner with  Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, offering a  moment for our amazing people to embrace their  individuality with pride. Optus float at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade 70 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Equity and inclusion  ===== PAGE 71 ===== We know that staying connected is critical to our  customers, especially in times of challenge. In  November 2023, we established our Australian- based Specialist Care Team to support our  vulnerable customers to access and maintain  connectivity in challenging times, such as when  they are experiencing the loss of a loved one,  financial hardship, natural disaster events,  domestic and family abuse, homelessness or  health issues. Participants in our Donate Your  Data™ program now also have access to this  Specialist Care Team.   To ensure our Specialist Care Team is equipped  to provide effective support to our customers,  we engaged external expertise to assess and  enhance the team’s capabilities and rolled out  tailored training for both the Specialist Care  Team and other Optus frontline teams to help  them identify, refer and support vulnerable  customers. Since its inception, our Specialist Care Team has  provided tailored support to 2,667 vulnerable  customers. We’re encouraged by the positive  feedback we’ve received from our customers  and look forward to continuing to enhance our  services and support options in future.  “Often customers who are  going through a challenging  time are unaware of the  external support that is  available to them. Being  part of the Specialist Care  Team means that I can help  customers with their specific  connectivity issues provide  financial relief and provide  customers with information  about support groups who  can help them through their  particular circumstances.” James Wilson   Senior Specialist Care Team Expert Case Study: Introducing our Specialist Care Team  71 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024  ===== PAGE 72 ===== Modern Slavery and Human Rights  Providing a safe and  equitable workplace Our commitment to respect the human rights of all  individuals means that we prioritise the identification and  management of potential risks associated with modern  slavery in our operations and supply chain. In FY24, we  released our fourth Modern Slavery Statement and  progressed the development of our supplier engagement  roadmap and commenced the review of selected suppliers  in high-risk supplier categories. We also want to ensure that our people are equipped to  identify and manage modern slavery risks. In January  2024, we updated our modern slavery e-learning module  to further tailor the content to Optus context and its  identified modern slavery risks.  In addition to all people leaders, we have extended this  required training to include our people in additional  business units which play a role in our modern slavery  response, such those working in Devices, Regulatory and  Public Affairs, and People and Culture. In FY24, 8,172  learners completed the module, of which 2,841 are staff  (42% of our workforce). We are committed to continuous improvement, learning  along the way, and strengthening our engagement with  suppliers to address ongoing challenges around modern  slavery. While we had no reported instances of modern  slavery relating to our operations or supply chain during  the reporting period, however, we understand this does  not mean no risks exist. Going forward, we remain committed to continuous  improvement, including delivering on key elements of  our action plan in the coming year. You can read our  2023 statement here, and we will be releasing our 2024  statement in September 2024.

This reflects our strong  commitment to empowering our customers,  our people and our community to thrive in  a resilient and sustainable future.  Since our inception, Optus has invested in  major infrastructure across the country, been  a significant Australian employer and acted on  the principles of good corporate citizenship. As  we all have begun to rely more on connectivity for  all services, including health, government support  and education, Optus plays an increasingly critical  role to Australians’ wellbeing and the broader  economy. As more businesses and communities  embrace the widely-recognised benefits of  digitalisation, we are prepared to support what  we know will be an increased reliance on our  services, and continue to make improvements  across our network, service and offerings.  As part of the Singtel Group, Optus plays an  integral part in the development and delivery  of the sustainability strategy with oversight at  Senior Executive and Board level. We undertake  a regular assessment to connect with the issues  that our stakeholders see as important for us to  address, and to clarify our sustainability priorities  for the coming period. In FY21, we completed a materiality assessment  which included an extensive internal and external  stakeholder review process to identify areas that  are most critical in our sustainability and business  strategy. From this, six key focus areas were  identified and have been embedded into  our revised sustainability strategy.  We are taking a proactive approach to ensure  our contribution to, and impact on, our community  and our environment is a positive one. This  approach has also seen us focus on embracing  the digital transformation and connecting our  community to a low-carbon future. We have  also set five-year targets to 2025 to measure  and track our progress and impact. This year, we welcomed Australian Formula One  driver, Daniel Ricciardo, to Optus as our Chief  of Optimism (COO). Daniel joins us to play an  important role in inspiring our people. Whether  it’s creating options in the heat of battle on the  racetrack through strategy and split-second  decisions, or the drive and determination to  continually seek improvement, or constantly  challenging himself and seeking feedback to  create advantages, Daniel’s infectious enthusiasm  and positive approach stands out from the crowd.  And it’s an approach we very much look forward  to amplifying throughout Optus as we continue  to bring our purpose to life.

As inherently  social beings, togetherness,  whether that is physically  or digitally, brings us joy. We  are proud that throughout  lockdowns and social  distancing, Optus has been  able to help our community  maintain and strengthen  their human connections. This past year has also strongly  reinforced how Optus' purpose  to ''power optimism with options''  aligns with what our customers  and people need most. We launched  our revitalised purpose at the  beginning of this period and  we have honed our vision and  strategy to bring our purpose  to life within the business. Our  vision is to be Australia’s most  loved everyday brand with lasting  customer relationships. Sustainability is integral to achieving  our vision, because winning the trust  that underpins lasting customer  relationships requires meeting  customer expectations about caring  for what matters most to them.  In line with customer and stakeholder  expectations, we revised our  sustainability strategy during  the year and have adopted more  ambitious targets for 2025 across  all areas of our strategy to contribute  to a future that we know is possible:  Climate Action, the Circular Economy,  Digital Enablement, Sustainable  Innovation, the Future of Work and  Equity and Inclusion. How we are  going about achieving those targets  is set out in this report.  We have created positive change  across all these areas in the past  year. Highlights include: 	• bridging the digital divide  for nearly 15,000 young  people through our Donate  Your Data™ program 	• winning the Australian  Packaging Covenant  Organisation Industry  sector award in  Telecommunications for  our efforts in sustainable  packaging for the fourth  year in a row 	• supporting five  technology-enabled social  entrepreneurs to grow and  scale their organisations  through our Future  Makers program 	• helping our people  develop future focused  skills through the launch  of Optus U 	• supporting the health and  wellbeing of our customers  during lockdown with the  launch of fitness content  to Optus Sport 	• undertaking a pilot Task  Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures  scenario analysis to help  us prepare for and adapt to the potential impacts  of climate change  	• publishing our first Modern  Slavery statement and  Human Rights statement  as we commit towards  respecting human rights  and freedom from modern  slavery of any kind, and 	• partnering with the  Minderoo Foundation  to develop a national  bushfire Detect &  Response capability.  These achievements are also  part of how we are addressing  the challenges raised by the UN  Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs). We have identified nine of  the 17 SDGs where we feel we can  make a strong contribution. More  detail about our SDG focus is on  page 52 of this report.  Fundamental to delivering our  purpose, our vision, and business  and sustainability strategies is our  amazing people. Across the whole  Optus family, our people are our  strongest assets. Our people rose  to the challenges of this past year,  putting customers at the heart of  what we do. Looking forward, we are focused  on building the capabilities of our  people, empowering them to think  differently, to embrace emerging  technologies and to help lead  innovation in our industry. We  continue to challenge ourselves to  strengthen our culture of inclusivity,  create a seamless digital and human  experience for our customers, ensure  no-one gets left behind in the digital  economy, and take meaningful  action to address climate change,  eliminate waste and protect  human rights. We look forward to working  with our teams to continue to  evolve our purpose-led culture,  to create signature experiences  for our customers, and to make  a positive lasting difference in our  communities. We are confident  we’ll achieve great things together.

As a leading Australian telecommunications  company, we are committed to creating a more connected  future for our community. An increasingly connected world provides the opportunity for  businesses, governments and not-for-profit organisations to  collaborate — and for all of us to connect in ways that enrich our  lives. In the vast land that is Australia, we are working to continually  improve our network and accessibility to enable everyone the  opportunity to be connected, wherever they are. 10 10 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Here’s what  we’re doing 5G supporting faster  connection We know that in an increasingly complex digital  world, 5G has the potential to transform our  communities, businesses and our society as  a whole. In FY21, we remained committed  to taking our 5G capabilities to new levels.  ‘Best Mobile Solution’ We won ‘Best Mobile Solution’ at the 2020  ACOMMS Awards for our Optus 5G Home  Internet solution providing customers with  next generation internet connectivity. Access Innovation Award We won a joint Access Innovation  Award with Ericsson at the 2020 World  Communication Awards (WCA) for  delivering the world’s first 2300MHz  and 3500MHz dual band 5G production  network. We were also shortlisted for  our Optus 5G Home Broadband in the  same category.

In FY21, we  confirmed a contract with Airbus Defence and  Space for a brand new, OneSat software-defined  satellite, Optus 11, to be deployed for Australia  and New Zealand in 2023. We will be the first satellite operator in  Asia-Pacific to launch a satellite that is fully  configurable in space. This means its location,  coverage, bandwidth and capacity can be  changed in orbit as our customer demands  evolve — where traditional satellites are limited  by on-ground configurations that cannot be  altered after launch. Network experience maps In FY21, we trialled new technology that helps  ensure our living network meets the needs and  demands of customers at home and on the go.  Our new network status map allows customers  to tell us when and where a problem is occurring  online, and opt-in to SMS/email updates about  a known issue or an issue they’ve reported. We are also leveraging automation, data and  analytics to simplify our processes and empower  our people to focus on customers with:  	• Automated case management to keep  customers informed; 	• Automated fault trending information  sent to our Networks Operations Centre,  serving as a faster warning system if  something goes wrong; and 	• Data and analytics to help us prioritise  network improvements, action faults,  and improve our radio frequency planning. Mobile Black Spot program The Mobile Black Spot Program is a Federal  Government initiative to improve and extend  mobile phone coverage in regional and remote  Australia. We have partnered with the Federal  Government and delivered over $138 million in  co-funding to provide dedicated connectivity  to thousands of Australians.  During Optus’ participation in the program,  we have been awarded 256 sites benefiting  thousands of properties in regional and rural  parts of Australia. Our base stations delivered  under the Mobile Blackspot Program have  generated 19.3 million calls, totalling 1 million  hours of airtime.  We are committed to continued investment  in our Australian mobile network to improve  coverage, reliability and speed. In FY21 ​we  switched on our 100th Mobile Black Spot  site at Boreen Point in the Shire of Noosa  on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast.

We  have mandatory privacy training for all staff,  and this training is augmented by targeted  training for key staff such as our customer  relationship team who assist customers in  resolving issues. We have also dedicated “privacy  champions” who represent each business unit and  assist in addressing any privacy queries. In FY21,  our privacy incident response plan was reviewed  and updated to ensure that our ability to  respond to major incidents was robust.  We record customer privacy complaints that  are referred to us from our customers, staff,  other individuals or regulatory bodies. In FY21,  there were 114 customer data complaints that  have been categorised as privacy incidents.  Of this, eleven cases were referred by the  Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO)  and one case from the Office of the Australian  Information Commissioner (OAIC). The threshold  to notify the Office of the Australian Information  Commissioner was not met for any of these  complaints during FY21 and therefore  no Notifiable Data Breaches were notified  to the OAIC from Optus for this period. We have also strengthened customer identity  verification and authentication with the launch of  Digital Identity with Mastercard. The service gives  our customers full control over what information  is shared and can only be accessed once the  user verifies their identity using the biometric  capabilities built into their mobile device. This  further minimises SIM-related fraud such as  SIM swapping. In FY21, Optus did not receive any fines  from either the Australian Competition and  Consumer Commission (ACCC) or the Australian  Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).  However, we were the subject of two non- monetary sanctions from ACMA during the year:  a formal warning on how we consult on network  deployment and an Enforceable Undertaking  regarding breaches of consumer protection  rules about how our customers migrate to the  National Broadband Network (NBN). In response  to these sanctions, we have agreed to report  quarterly to the ACMA for 12 months on our  compliance under the Enforceable Undertaking  and we have reviewed our network deployment  consultation processes and undertaken training  with our consultants who carry out these public  consultations on our behalf. Multi-access Edge Compute  infrastructures We have recently worked with Amazon Web  Services Outposts to expand our 5G ecosystem.  This provides the opportunity for companies  to explore new capabilities, including private  connectivity and real-time data analytics. 13 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance Helping People  Connect  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Protecting  our  Environment At Optus, we recognise our role in connecting our community to a low- carbon future and keeping them safe during times of natural disasters.  We have a long history of working to improve the environmental  performance of our operations and supporting our community to join  us on the journey towards a sustainable and resilient future. 14 14 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance  ===== PAGE 15 ===== Climate Action Climate change presents urgent challenges  for business, governments, and society. It  is our priority to understand, mitigate and  manage the material risks that we can  address through strategic action. 2025 Target Reduce carbon  emissions by 25%  We aim to collaborate with  customers and partners to reduce  climate risk and achieve the global  goal of no more than 1.5ºC of warming 1 Reduced  77,000 tCO2e  per year  through our investments in  energy efficiency initiatives FY21 Highlights Undertook a pilot Task Force on  Climate-related  Financial Disclosures  (TCFD) scenario analysis to identify  opportunities and risks as we  move toward a low-carbon future CO2 15 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance Protecting our  Environment HOME  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Here’s what  we’re doing  Tackling emissions We are playing our part in the transition  towards a lower carbon future. We understand the power of collaboration  to achieve the global goal of no more than 1.5ºC  of warming by the end of the century and we are  proud to have been the first telecommunications  company in Australia to commit to the Science  Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and get them  approved in 2017. We strengthened our  commitment by setting out to achieve net-zero  emissions by 2050 and by working with our  stakeholders to halve our absolute emissions  between 2015 and 2030.  Energy efficiency For us, energy efficiency goes hand in hand with  carbon reduction, as electricity represents about  95% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Significant  growth in network coverage and use of mobiles  across Australia has increased our energy  consumption as we expand capacity through  our network, base stations and network facilities.  To offset this, we have made significant efforts  to improve the efficiency of our energy use. We are reducing over 90 GWh or 77,000 tCO2e  every year as a result of the energy efficiency  investments we have made over the last few  years. This has helped us to manage a 46%  increase in data traffic last year as a result  of COVID-19 with only a 4% increase in the  energy we used to power our network. Our initiatives 	• To mitigate our growing energy needs,  we’ve been upgrading and converting  our base stations to become more energy  efficient. Through these upgrades, we’ve  improved efficiencies during low data  traffic times with the activation of  energy-saving functions, resulting  in an annual electricity savings of  10,952 MWh  	• We continue rolling out energy-efficient  LED lighting and motion detecting  sensors in our facilities, saving 1,577  MWh per year 	• Legacy infrastructure has been shut  down and decommissioned, achieving  savings of over 50,000 MWh per year. Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  As part of the Singtel Group, Optus was an early  adopter of the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) which launched in  2017. The TCFD framework requires companies  to identify and report on how they are managing  their climate risks. The related guidelines have  been used to guide Optus’ governance, strategy,  risk management and target setting around  climate risks.  We decided early on to take a staged approach  to implementing the TCFD recommendations,  so that we could provide a considered response  through meaningful actions. In 2016, we undertook  our first climate scenario analysis to understand  the physical risks to our infrastructure, which  resulted in various infrastructure adaptations.  To enhance our understanding of physical and  transitional risks, in FY21, we completed a TCFD  scenario analysis on a pilot region in northern  New South Wales. We selected the Northern  Rivers region, as it is one of our major market  areas that is vulnerable to physical changes in  the climate and highly likely to face significant  disruption from extreme weather events. The pilot scenario analysis involved stress- testing our infrastructure against plausible  climate futures. We forecasted the potential  impacts of climate change over three different  scenarios and under three separate time horizons.  This exercise included the identification of  transitional risks which are likely to arise as we  move towards a low-carbon economy, such as  economic or regulatory changes, and physical  risks arising from the impact of extreme weather  events, such as the Black Summer fires of  2019/20 on our operations.  Understanding the potential impacts of climate  change enables us to prepare for and adapt to  any future negative impacts that may affect  our ability to keep Australians connected, even  in the most challenging circumstances. This pilot  has allowed us to refine our physical impact  financial modelling and validate the most material  drivers and assumptions that will impact Optus’  financials before this is expanded to a national  level study over the 2021-2022 period. For a detailed overview of how Optus governs  and assesses its climate risks, and our strategy  to address these risks refer to the Singtel Group  Sustainability Report 2021. CLIMATE ACTION 16 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance Protecting our  Environment HOME  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Supporting  Resilience Telecommunications services are crucial  to keeping communities safe, connected  and informed. This is never more apparent  than during times of disaster or emergency,  when telecommunications networks support  response efforts and resilience. In September  2020, the NSW Government released its Final  Report of the NSW Bushfire Inquiry. It stated  that throughout the fires, the community  valued telecommunications above all  other services. We believe that our best defence against  bushfires is early detection and extinguishment.  Accomplishing this requires coordination of  expertise, assets and resources, so we are  working in collaboration with other organisations  to protect Australians when they need it the most. 17 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance Protecting our  Environment HOME  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Supporting Resilience  (continued) Disaster risk reduction Automated bushfire detection  Optus recognises that climate change is already  contributing to hotter and more intense bushfires.  In response, together with the Australian National  University (ANU), we have stepped up and  partnered with Minderoo Foundation to develop  a national bushfire Detect and Response  capability. This is one layer of The Minderoo  Foundation’s Fire Shield, a four-year project that  aims to reduce the impact of bushfires by being  able to extinguish dangerous fires within one hour. Our areas of focus: 1.	 Detect — immediately identify fires from  the air, ground and space. 2.	 Share — share information in real time  for immediate decisions. 3.	 Predict — have a forward view of what  a fire will do. 4.	 Respond — respond quickly to extinguish  fire which is deemed to be a threat. In the short-term, the ANU-Optus Bushfire  Research Centre of Excellence will develop  an autonomous ground-based and aerial fire  detection system. ANU will bring their scientific  expertise in fire ignition risks, while Optus will  provide appropriate communication systems. By 2022, the program proposes launching a  constellation of satellites, managed by ANU,  to complement the fire detection system.  The program will look to be augmented by a  geostationary satellite to help spot and track  fires as well as deploy extinguishing technologies. Australian Business Roundtable  for Disaster Resilience and Safer  Communities (ABR) We continue to contribute as a founding member  of the Australian Business Roundtable for Disaster  Resilience and Safer Communities (ABR), which  includes IAG, Westpac, Australian Red Cross and  Munich Re. Through this collaboration, we work  at a policy and research level to build the nation’s  climate and disaster risk reduction knowledge.  We are also actively involved in the National  Disaster Risk Reduction (NDRR) Industry  Advisory Forum to shape the implementation  of Australia’s first National Disaster Risk  Reduction (NDRR) Framework. We have further enhanced our climate resilience  adaptation by procuring and deploying the  following assets: 	• Seven new Small Cell SatCats; 	• 30 long run portable diesel fuel pods; 	• Five Tipper Trailers to support  deployment of the above;  	• 37 Optus generators equipped with  additional 3 phase 415v outlets, remote  supervisory systems and quick connect  fuel inlets to allow connection to long  run fuel pods; and 	• Nine trailer mounted diesel  refuelling systems. 18 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance Protecting our  Environment HOME  ===== PAGE 19 ===== COVID-19 Response We knew that during the height of the COVID-19  pandemic, keeping our customers connected was  more critical than ever before. With the loss of  90% of our call centre capacity due to lockdowns  in India, Philippines and Australia, we knew we  had to go above and beyond our ‘normal’ plans  and operations, to embrace the challenge and  redefine our operations to deliver support for  our customers and keep them connected. We are proud to have received a Comms Day  ‘COVID response’ award for our significant effort  and response to Australians’ needs during the  pandemic. It’s great recognition of how teams  across Optus placed people at the centre of our  decisions when confronted with the pandemic’s  challenges. We also put in place a range of  measures to help customers and the community  stay connected: 	• We employed an additional 500 staff  from industries affected by the COVID-19  downturn and transferred their excellent  customer service skills to Optus  	• We provided a three-month postpaid  mobile access fee waiver for AHPRA  registered health workers to say thank  you. 79,648 customers received the  health care worker offer 	• We launched a range of support  initiatives for Optus customers including  bonus data boosts, unlimited broadband,  pausing of plans and late payment fees,  and a support package for customers  that required financial assistance  	• For our Small and Medium Business  (SMB) clients, Optus set up a series of  initiatives to manage higher connectivity  needs and remote ways of working,  including a free trial of Optus Loop Live  — one of our most popular business tools 	• We promoted virtual volunteering  opportunities that Optus staff could  support and charities at the COVID-19  frontline that our staff could donate  to via the yes4good Optus giving portal 	• We distributed ‘emergency’ SIMS and  47 iPads to support charities that are at  the frontline working in crisis centres and  domestic and family violence support 	• Ensured our people working in contact  centres in India and the Philippines were  provided safe working conditions and  dedicated transport if needed. Rapid Response Research grants Optus is empowering La Trobe University  researchers who are rapidly embarking on ways  to improve community health and wellbeing as  a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with new  targeted grants in collaboration with La Trobe  and Medibank. Called the ‘Rapid Response Research’ grants,  three new projects will receive a total of  $250,000 to investigate the mental and  physical health impacts of working from home,  telehealth physiotherapy rehabilitation for  cancer survivors and virtual care technologies. 	• Mental and physical health impacts of  working from home (Lead researcher:  Associate Professor Jodi Oakman,  $100,000): The researchers will assess  and gather data on the mental and  physical health impacts of working from  home. The project will develop guidelines  on how to protect and optimise employee  health and wellbeing while working  from home 	• Telerehabilitation for cancer survivors  (Lead researcher: Dr Amy Dennett,  $50,000): This project will evaluate  a comprehensive package of telehealth  physical rehabilitation for people with  cancer. The package will include virtual  group exercise, one-on-one health  coaching, and an interactive online  information portal 	• Virtual care technologies (Lead  researchers: Professor Ani Desai and  Professor James Boyd, $100,000):  This project will develop a framework  to evaluate virtual care models, such  as remote health monitoring of patients  discharged from hospitals who are at  high risk of remission or for the ongoing  monitoring of patient health in the  residential aged care settings.

We are doing this by  prioritising the reduction of resources  first and foremost, the elimination of  waste to landfill by reusing or recycling  resources where possible, and the  increased use of regenerative resources.  We are taking a strong stance on  minimising the impact of our goods  and services on the environment  and community.  Our approach takes a life-cycle view  encompassing the environmental impact  before products reach our stores, during  our operations and after their useful life. 2025 Targets FY21 Highlights  Received the 2020 Australian Packaging  Covenant Organisation (APCO) Industry  Sector Award in Telecommunications for  efforts towards sustainable packaging  for the fourth year in a row 90% waste diversion  from landfill:  Reusing, recycling and  repurposing, keeping  everything in use as part  of the circular economy Reuse and recycle  over 90% of our  e-waste:  The more we give back,  the more we get back 100% recyclable,  reusable or  compostable packaging: Moving away from single-use  materials so nothing is wasted Recycled 68,456 SIM cards as part of our SIM expiry recall initiative Over 63,500  Fetch TV set top boxes  were returned for recycling 5.27 tonnes of packaging was made  from post-industrial recycled polypropylene Recycled  nearly 4,000 kgs  of mobile phone components  including handsets, batteries,  chargers & accessories 1 2 3 Added the Australasian  Recycling Label (ARL)  to packaging in our  prepaid portfolio to  reduce recycling confusion 20 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance Protecting our  Environment HOME  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Here’s what  we’re doing  CIRCULAR ECONOMY 1. Before We are committed to collaborating  with transparent and ethical, socially and  environmentally responsible suppliers. As part  of the Singtel Group, we have a Supplier Code  of Conduct which encourages suppliers to  consider, and adopt, effective environmental  management practices. For example, we expect  suppliers to identify and use packaging that will  be recyclable and efficient. 2. During Sustainable packaging has a direct and indirect  contribution to our carbon and environmental  footprint across our value chain, from resource  utilisation, product packaging all the way to  their waste streams.  Our Sustainable Packaging Goals were initially  developed in FY19 and progressively refined  during FY20 into a set of ten clear and concise  targets. The targets outline sustainable packaging  goals around weight reduction and optimisation,  recyclability and recoverability of materials, waste  diversion from landfill, and other key improvement  areas. When new products or services are being  developed, environmental considerations must  be made to ensure alignment to our targets. All  Optus-branded devices will then be run through  our Sustainable Packaging Checklist.  In FY21, we also focused on rolling out the  Australian Recycling Label (ARL) in our prepaid  portfolio and we will continue doing so for the  rest of our products. A leader in sustainable packaging We work to reduce our packaging wherever  possible. We’re proud to have been awarded  the 2020 Australian Packaging Covenant  Organisation (APCO) Industry Sector Award  in Telecommunications for efforts towards  sustainable packaging for the fourth consecutive  year. This annual recognition reflects our hard  work towards reducing our use of packaging  materials without compromising functionality.  APCO 2020 Industry Sector Award in Telecommunications In FY21, we identified additional opportunities  to minimise our impact on the environment.  We want to reduce the negative impact of  polypropylene (PP) in our products. In 2020,  5.27 tonnes of packaging was made from post- industrial recycled polypropylene. This material  can then be returned for recycling to the  manufacturer. We are committed to continual  improvement, which is why our focus for FY22  is to identify a more sustainable option to  replace PP completely.

After In our sector, e-waste is the most material waste  stream due to the potential for pollution from  metals, plastics and batteries from mobile phones.  Our major focus has been around the recovery  and recycling of the valuable and reusable raw  materials found in e-waste, particularly  mobile phones. Giving our e-waste a second life brings huge  savings for energy, water, greenhouse gas  emissions, and cost, but also means that we  can keep more of these precious resources in  the ground. In Australia, we recycle over 98%  of our own e-waste.  Our e-waste recycling initiatives can be traced  back to 1998, when we became a founding  member of Mobile Muster. Since then, we have  seen a compounded annual growth in collection  rates of 550% and this effort has since recovered  over 45,000 kg of mobile phones, batteries and  accessories. In FY21, we diverted 3,458 kg of  e-waste, avoided 7.68 tonnes of carbon emissions  and conserved 39.17 tonnes of mineral resources.  Our initiatives include: 	• Modem recycling — Our customers can  drop any used Optus branded modems  into one of our stores for recycling,  where 95% of materials are recovered  and reused.  	• Mobile Muster program — We continue  to support the Mobile Muster program,  a national industry-wide collaboration  and stewardship scheme that allows  customers to recycle their old mobile  phones at any Optus retail store.  	• SIM card recycling — We are proud to  have recycled 68,456 SIM cards as part  of our SIM expiry recall initiative in FY21. 	• Postal drop off service — This service  enables leased Optus devices to be  returned via Australia Post. Over 63,500  Fetch TV set-top boxes were returned  through the postal drop off service.  These are then consolidated and sent  back to the warehouses, reducing the  amount of additional courier packaging  and transport emissions. 	• Printer waste — In collaboration with  Lexmark, we have rolled out an update  to Retail printers to reduce the amount  of toner that is being used. 22 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance Protecting our  Environment HOME  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Amazing  People 23 Above: Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, CEO and Libby Roy, MD Business participating  in National Pyjama Day.

By providing support and promoting initiatives around accessibility, we  promote inclusion for everyone. Our Accessibility and Inclusion Action Plan is our commitment to become  a disability confident employer as well as becoming more accessible to  our customers. Our goal is to create accessible connections, solutions and  services across our customer and community touch points; and enable our  people to deliver exceptional customer experiences.  We focus on four key priority areas: 1.	 Enabling Work — to foster an accessible, supportive and inclusive  workplace with equal opportunities for everyone to participate. 2.	 Enabling Customer Experience — by ensuring our products, services  and support are accessible to customers with disability. 3.	 Enabling Communities — by connecting people with disability to  reach their potential through our digital technologies and innovative  community programs. 4.	 Enabling Innovations — through the development of assistive and  enabling technologies that support independent living and employability.

We champion inclusion and connection; with  each other and especially with our customers.  Many of our Retail Stores have team members  who are fluent in other languages like Mandarin,  Cantonese, Hindi, Arabic, Korean, Vietnamese,  Spanish and Italian, just to name a few. We’re also committed to identifying and  promoting opportunities for Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander peoples to reach their  career goals through our partnership with  the KARI Foundation. We partner with  CareerTrackers, a not-for-profit organisation  that helps place Indigenous university students  in high-value added jobs in professional and  corporate sectors.

Health and safety  Our goal is to continuously improve our performance in preventing  workplace-related injuries. Our workplace injury frequency rate in FY21  is 1.5. Our workplace fatality rate remained at 0 in FY21, and the  absenteeism rate has reduced to 0.013. In FY21, we maintained our certification of AS4801, the Australian Standard  for Safety Management. We gained certification of the new International  Standard for Safety Management, ISO:45001, in several of our business  units. This reflects our commitment to meeting a high standard of safety  management systems. During FY22, we will continue to transition and  become fully certified with ISO:45001.  We also successfully passed the audit by the Office of the Federal Safety  Commissioner in November 2020 to confirm our compliance with their  regulatory expectations associated with the use of Australian Federal  Government funding. Wellbeing  For our employees In FY21, we launched our employee assistance program, Your Health Matters.  This initiative focuses on a holistic, preventative and integrated approach  to health and wellbeing. Our people and their immediate family members  have access to a range of support services including counselling and coaching  (resilience, mindfulness, nutrition, sleep and fatigue, physical activity), legal  and finance support. In addition, through the Your Health Matters program  our people have access to an online wellness gateway that has various  interactive assessments, monthly ‘pillars of health’ webinars, videos, podcasts  and articles to help raise awareness and knowledge to make better health  and wellbeing decisions. We also launched virtual workouts to help our people stay motivated and  moving during COVID-19. Our people across Australia have access to a wide  range of virtual workouts, including yoga and meditation, so they can work  out anywhere or anytime.  Throughout FY21, we maintained our position of mutual respect in  support of our frontline workers. This marks a shift away from a position  where ‘the customer is always right’ in response to increasing levels of  customer intimidation and aggression. We also continued to promote  good mental health through our two e-learning courses — ‘Mental health  in your workplace’ (for all employees) and ‘Managing mental health in  your workplace’ (for people leaders).

So far, we’ve partnered with Flow Athletic  and Fitness Playground, creators of Virtual Playground, which means Optus  Sport customers can try yoga, dance, cardio and fast fat-burners, in addition  to core strength sessions and Pilates routines. This content is free to all  existing Optus Sport users with more partners coming on board.  We also partnered with AIA Australia to inspire consumer wellness and  encourage people to live more active and healthier lifestyles. Optus and  AIA customers will have access to exclusive offers to provide extra motivation  for them to start their wellbeing journey and achieve their health and fitness  goals via the AIA Vitality program, their use of wearable devices, and the  connectivity that Optus provides. This partnership will continue to evolve  over time with an expanded range of offers and functionalities, with the  focus on driving a connected health experience to enrich the lives and  wellbeing of our customers. For our community In FY21, we continued our relationship with Optus Future Maker,  Virtualpsychologist, to support the wellbeing of regional communities  through Australia’s first text-based counselling service. This reflects our  strong commitment to ensuring that wellbeing and mental health support  services are readily available to customers in rural and remote parts of the  country, especially during these challenging times. Virtualpsychologist, which was a for-purpose start up in our 2017 Future  Maker program, is delivered by qualified mental health professionals, offering  a select range of text based psychological and counselling support services to  individuals and those in rural and remote settings irrespective of their mobile  carrier. For post-paid and prepaid customers who don’t have plans with text  allowances included, Optus has enabled free text rates to ensure they  have the resources in place to access support.

We recognise this and see our contractors  as part of our Optus family. The type of work we commission and manage  through contractors can range from low to high  Work Health & Safety (WHS) risk, including  high risk construction work. We are committed  to creating and maintaining a safe and healthy  working environment, which is why we have  implemented Donesafe — a digital platform for  all staff and contractors focused on improving  WHS processes, controls, incident reporting  and management.  Using this system, our contractors complete an  induction through Donesafe, which covers WHS  requirements applicable to all Optus sites and  specific business units. Our contractors are also  notified of our WHS Incident Notification Hotline  used for the immediate reporting of serious safety  incidents. This year no fatalities were recorded. Ensuring a responsible supply chain Human rights and modern slavery Optus believes in a future where every human has  freedom and independence — where all individuals  are protected from slavery in any form. As a  signatory to the United Nations Global Compact  since 2007, we are committed to its ten principles  and we support the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs), which includes Goal  8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.  In FY21, we published our first Modern Slavery  Statement in line with the Commonwealth  Modern Slavery Act 2018. This Statement is the  first part of our ongoing commitment to report  on our approach, policies, progress and plans to  ensure respect for human rights and freedom  from modern slavery of any kind. The statement  outlines our business structure, modern slavery  risks in our operations and supply chain and how  we are mitigating against such risks. We have a  part to play in continuing to evolve our sustainable  supply chain practices, as well as to manage any  risks in our own operations.  We undertook a number of actions as part  of our commitment to human rights including: 	• Updating our Group Supplier Code  of Conduct to incorporate measures  addressing labour and human rights.  It will be communicated to suppliers  at the commencement of new tender  processes to ensure they understand  the expectations for working with the  Singtel Group; 	• Publishing our first Human  Rights statement; 	• Launching modern slavery e-learning  modules as required learning for all  Optus leaders and selected staff; and  	• Rolling out communications to all staff  to increase awareness and communicating  about our whistle-blower hotline to  report any concerns.

The role of social media in achieving  this is growing as we move into the digital age.  We are leveraging the power of social media to  ensure the voices of our Optus family are heard  through our Talent Ambassador Program, which  was launched in 2019. The program elevates our  people’s voices by inspiring them to celebrate,  promote, and showcase their career at Optus on  LinkedIn through a united hashtag, #OptusLife.  In FY21, we received 185 applications and chose  a diverse group of 78 Ambassadors, increasing  our cohort to 100 ambassadors. Throughout  the year, our ambassadors were provided with  tailored training and a development program  to evolve their personal brand and social media  marketing skills. This program is proving to be a successful two- way exchange — our Ambassadors are standing  out from their peers and our recruitment team  is getting organic brand awareness. Since October 2019, the program has:  	• Generated over 1.3 million organic views  from #OptusLife posts, saving over  $150,000 in advertising costs 	• Given a 356% uplift in LinkedIn  company pageviews in the first  30 days of the program  Skills for future success Intelligent Automation Academy Our Intelligent Automation Academy is a learning  pathway that supports our employees to develop  the skills and capabilities that will be in future  demand.

This training commitment enables us to better  support the digital transformation of Australian businesses by delivering  new end-to-end cloud services and migration support. Optus U: Micro-credential program Optus U is about embracing  and sharing new skills that drive  a difference for our customers,  people and business. To help make  this happen, we’ve joined forces  with La Trobe University and  Macquarie University to create  bespoke curriculums and deliver  five micro-credential programs  that focus on the skills needed to drive our business to future success.  We are committed to supporting our people by providing study leave,  access to coaches and business sponsors, while they undertake the  recognised certifications and accreditations. Optus Agile  On the back of such a difficult year for many charities, Optus Agile coaches  formed a skills transfer workshop to enable ten charities to attend a three- day workshop. During this time, each of the charities were upskilled in the  Agile way of working — improving their operational and communicative  strategies, laying a base to their 2021 recovery.

This year we continued our successful  CX Academy — a set of training programs tailored to build and  improve Optus customer experience and service outcomes. Innovation mindset At Optus, we are using our creativity to improve the way we meet our  customers’ needs. In FY21, we launched the Optus Innovation Mindset  Hackathon series to help facilitate this. Secure payments Our first Innovation Mindset Hackathon on secure payments showed what  we can achieve when we’re energised by what’s possible, think differently  and embrace emerging technologies. The two-day hackathon brought 78  people together into 11 teams to solve the challenge: How might we set up  secure payment mechanisms to enable our customers to pay their accounts  with debit or credit cards across all payment gateways and touchpoints,  including new channels? Teams worked together to brainstorm, ideate and create prototypes to pitch  to our judges. Our winning team was ‘The PayPals’. This team’s innovation  stood out for being a thorough solution that covered all payment types and  was presented as a working prototype. This prototype will continue to be  developed before being introduced into the business to solve this customer  pain point. Digital check-up Another hackathon in the series focused on solving the challenge: How  might we address levers of customer churn in digital experiences (perception  of network and value) so that we reduce churn and create connections to  become Australia’s most loved everyday brand? Our winning team was the ‘Digital Check-up’. This team’s innovation stood  out for being a detailed solution that resonated with all the judges. Their  pitch was shown through the lens of a customer and how they’d use it.  It was a great use case that our customers would take hold of and had  potential in being incorporated into our current app. Our people participating in our Innovation mindset hackathons 35 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance HOME Amazing  People  ===== PAGE 36 ===== One of the most impactful ways to  spread optimism is to get out into  our communities and support those  who need us. We’re committed to  leveraging our resources, relationships  and capabilities to make a positive  contribution in our society.  Our range of social impact programs and  community initiatives focus on improving  educational outcomes and employment  pathways for disadvantaged individuals  and groups, closing the digital divide and  encouraging safe and respectful online  behaviours for young people and families.  Working with our charity and community  partners to encourage knowledge and skills  transfer, developing leadership and agile  ways of working through skilled volunteering  workshops also ensures that we are  addressing genuine areas of need and  helps us to increase our impact and  improve our own learning. Last year (2020) will long be remembered for  the impact of COVID-19, our teams continued  to seek ways to support the community.  While many face-to-face programs  shifted towards online delivery, our people  continued to get involved in volunteering and  fundraising opportunities. Together we raised  over $265,000 for 289 charities and spent  over 8,200 hours volunteering.

This initiative provides disadvantaged and  vulnerable high school students with retail  and employability skills, and the confidence  to find and keep a job, both within Optus  and the broader retail sector. Since December 2016, 591 students have  participated in the program, with 58 jobs  offered to students in our retail stores as casual  employees. In 2020, the program was impacted  by COVID-19 which saw our team rapidly pivot  to a virtual delivery of the program. Over the  year, we ran five digital workshops mentoring  50 students on job readiness skills.  Latrobe Youth Film Festival online Another one of our online volunteering  opportunities this year was our involvement  with Latrobe Youth Film Festival Online (LYFFO).  LYFFO is a short film festival for young people  aged 12-25 living in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria.  Due to COVID-19, the film festival needed to  pivot online, and with support from our people  across the business, we were able to continue  to upskill their cohort through online mentoring  and workshops. Our teams shared their skills and  knowledge around themes such as production  and directing, use of a camera, optimal lighting,  and presenting. Our people also provided tips to  younger presenters through mentoring sessions. ABCN partnership This year we celebrated 15 years of partnership  with the Australian Business and Community  Network (ABCN). As a founding member company  of ABCN, we work closely to support students  from low socio-economic backgrounds to achieve  their potential. Our ABCN mentoring programs  kicked off the year with big plans, but rapidly  pivoted to digital delivery to ensure we continued  to reach students — even those in lockdown at  home. All states managed to get involved and  we ran 26 programs over the year, reaching nearly  1,900 students. 124 of our people supported these  students as mentors, and our South Australian  team were even able to increase their program  delivery despite the lockdowns. We also had many of our mentors record  words of encouragement that were published  to students around themes of resilience, learning,  growth and goals — and through these ABCN  Connects videos, we reached an estimated  1,600 students. One of the most rewarding initiatives of FY21  was the Partners in Learning co-mentoring  relationship between our CEO, Kelly Bayer  Rosmarin and Oran Park High School Principal,  Brad Mitchell. Oran Park High School only opened  its doors in February 2020, just weeks before the  NSW lockdown came into effect. Brad was thrilled  to be able to gain insights from Kelly’s experience  throughout this season.

While COVID-19 impacted our program plans, we were able  to highlight and raise awareness of our Indigenous Australian  ties throughout NAIDOC week.  As part of our celebrations, we unveiled a new Indigenous  artwork specially created for us by KARI. Artist Brian de Vries  created it to honour the collaboration between Optus and KARI.  Called “Community Togetherness” it captures the journey of  coming together and sharing knowledge with each other. The  artwork featured on screensavers, Life TV, email banners and  even hoodies. Hoodies were worn by many of our senior leaders  during NAIDOC week and were available for sale to our people. KARI Foundation honoured the work of Optus, and specifically  the contribution of Helen Maisano, awarding her the KARI  Champion of Change Award for 2020. This annual award is  given to a person who works to strengthen the communication  of Aboriginal Australia, both in their organisation and the  wider community.

Tour de Cure For the eleventh year, we have supported the Tour  de Cure and their mission to find a cure for cancer.  In March 2021, six Optus riders embarked on the  challenging Tour de Cure ride from Newcastle  to Coffs Harbour via the New England region,  cycling 900km in seven days. Throughout the  ride, Team Optus was involved in vital fundraising  and promoting messages on the importance of  healthy lifestyles.  The NELUNE Foundation The NELUNE Foundation is a charity that  provides psychological and practical support,  assistance and care for public hospital and  underprivileged cancer patients of all ages. The Foundation has established two cancer  treatment centres in Darlinghurst and Randwick. Our support is dedicated to wholly funding the  provision of two patient transport vehicles to help  get cancer patients to and from appointments. In FY21, Optus donated $230,000 to help  provide practical and tangible support for cancer  patients receiving treatment in the NSW public  hospital service.

Following our support  of this event, we welcomed the Pyjama Foundation as our new permanent  guests at our campus in Sydney. This enables them to use our facilities to  help train a backlog of Pyjama Angels who haven’t been able to complete  training face to face throughout the pandemic.  Grow Together As a leading telecommunications provider, we’re all about closing the digital  divide. We also recognise that many seniors are not as digitally savvy as they  would like to be and so we partnered with not-for-profit, PlantingSeeds  on their Grow Together initiative. Together, we have helped seniors develop  confidence in using smartphones and technology to connect with friends,  family, and nature. We’ve developed training manuals, and our people  have participated in volunteering events to help seniors stay connected  as technology rapidly evolves.

Working with The Smith Family, we raised funds for  100 gift vouchers to help towards the purchase of a smartphone so that  more young people can participate in our Donate Your Data™ program. Jumping for Literacy Finally, many of our staff became official World Record Holders in a  unique fundraising event hosted by United Way. Jumping for Literacy  challenged people to jump in the air while taking a selfie and then upload  to social media within a specific time frame. The event set a world record  for “the most photos of people jumping uploaded to Facebook in one hour”. We had 70 people participate, raising nearly $1,500 which will enable us to  support 14 children for 12 months through the Imagination Library program,  with 168 books sent to them.

We recognise  that as a leader in telecommunications,  we can play a key role in helping to equip  the next generation to be safe and  resilient online citizens as well as helping  bridge the digital divide that exists for  so many young people who are simply  being left behind because they don’t  have regular access to the internet. That is why we are working collaboratively  with schools, community organisations and  our customers to deliver the knowledge,  tools and accessibility required to help young  Australians thrive in today’s ever-changing  digital world. Our main goal is to empower  our vulnerable and disadvantaged youth with  opportunities to achieve, thrive and belong.  Since 2013, we have been delivering  educational workshops that have supported  more than 390,000 primary and secondary  school students across Australia through our  Digital Thumbprint program. In FY21, nearly  62,000 primary and secondary students  completed a workshop across Australia,  including those in our regional communities. Through our Donate Your Data™ program,  launched in December 2019, we are bringing  digital inclusion to disadvantaged young  people, including students supported by  a range of charities, including The Smith  Family, Mission Australia, KARI Foundation,  yourtown, ABCN, Girls Academy, The  Salvation Army, Story Factory, and Sydney  Children’s Hospital Foundation. Digital  Thumbprint workshops are also offered to  these students’ schools to prepare them for  having a safe and positive experience online.

Digital Thumbprint program Our award-winning Digital Thumbprint program supports young people and  families with tools and resources that promote safe, responsible and positive  online behaviours.  Since its inception in 2013, Digital Thumbprint has educated more than  390,000 primary and secondary students across Australia. The program  has been endorsed by the eSafety Commissioner as a Trusted eSafety  Provider. In FY21, the Digital Thumbprint program was delivered to nearly  62,000 students, supporting them to protect their personal information  and build respectful relationships online. This includes over 700 students  who participated in our new teacher-led digital interactive workshops  that were launched in November 2020.  Our new interactive digital workshops are  designed for year seven and eight students and  cover five key topics: cyber security, cyberbullying  and respectful relationships online, digital  identity, digital balance and fake news and digital  discernment. Free for schools, they can be led in  school by teachers or students can work through  at their own pace. These workshops can be  accessed on a range of devices, making them  easy to integrate into class activities, or to be  delivered remotely. Last year changed the way students spent their time online, especially when  it comes to a greater focus on schooling and educational purposes. We want  to ensure young people are equipped to best navigate the digital world. Our  program helps students take home some valuable skills when it comes to  cybersecurity, verifying credible information and what to keep in mind to  create a positive digital thumbprint. This means we’re providing more  options than ever before to educate young teens about staying safe online. Reaching regional young people remains critical and over 23,800 students  participated in regional roadshows via digital and face to face delivery.  The team travelled across Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales  and Tasmania. We also delivered workshops for parents across nine  communities and developed new guides and vlogs for parents and teens  covering how to stay safe on popular platforms such as TikTok, as well  as advice to support a balance with screen time. The resources are free  to download on the Digital Thumbprint website.  Safer Internet Day We proudly supported Safer Internet Day on February 9th this year. Over  the course of the week students participated in our new online Digital  Thumbprint workshops. We also relaunched our face-to-face workshops in  metro and regional schools after being away due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Media surrounding the regional workshops garnered an impressive reach of  3,978,460 across regional media. We also engaged customers via Facebook,  Instagram with Optus Ambassador Taryn Brumfitt, and messaging in  My Optus app. Safer Internet Day 2021 and Taryn Brumfitt 44 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance HOME Digital   Enablement  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Donate Your Data™  In December 2019, we launched a digital inclusion initiative Donate  Your Data™, which helps bridge the digital divide for young Australians  living in disadvantage. The COVID-19 pandemic further amplified the digital gap that exists  for many young people and their families which affected their access to  education and learning, employment opportunities and telehealth services. This program invites eligible Optus Postpaid and Prepaid Mobile customers  to donate their data to young Australians who need it most. The data is then  pooled and shared with young people supported by our charity partners.  Our charity partners help ensure the data will get to where it is needed  most and currently include: The Smith Family, Mission Australia, KARI  Foundation, yourtown, ABCN, Girls Academy, The Salvation Army,  Story Factory, and Sydney Children’s Hospital Foundation.  Feedback from some of our Donate Your Data™ participants:  “If I didn’t have the data,  I wouldn’t be able to do my  studies. I wouldn’t be able to  do homework. I wouldn’t be  able to do anything like that.” Amelia, participant with  The Smith Family  “Words can’t describe how grateful and thankful  I am to Optus and their customers for the data.  Amelia is a very intelligent person. I would just  love for her to get a good education and a good job.  It’s my dream, and the support from Optus and  The Smith Family is helping us get there.”  Laurel, mother of Amelia, a participant with The Smith Family  “COVID-19 has meant we’ve all had to adapt to  new ways of working, including patients and staff  at the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network. They’ve  created new ways of working and embarked on  Telehealth models of care to ensure that patients  who haven’t been able to visit the hospitals for  treatment, continue to get the support and care  they need and deserve. We were seeing that not all  families had the sufficient data capacity for these  consultations, so we are extremely grateful to Optus  for partnering with us to support families and ensure  they have enough data to enable them to receive  their consultations and treatments remotely.” Nicola Stokes, Sydney Children’s Hospitals Foundation, CEO Here’s what we’re  doing (continued) DIGITAL ENABLEMENT Impact since the program’s  launch in December 2019 Donations from more than 440,000 unique customers 25.5 million GB  of data donated from customers Nearly 15,000  young people helped with thousands more being supported  through the program in the coming year Laurel and Amelia 45 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance HOME Digital   Enablement  ===== PAGE 46 ===== Sustainable  Innovation 46 46 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Digital   Enablement Sustainable  Innovation Governance  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Our infrastructure is critical to powering  sustainable solutions in this digital age.

This year we ran our fourth Future Makers program supporting five new  social start-ups. Future Makers is a social innovation accelerator that aims  to support impact start-ups leveraging technology to address education  (SDG 4), employment (SDG 8), or health (SDG 3) challenges faced by  vulnerable people. The six-month program is inclusive and open to start-ups, social  entrepreneurs and not-for-profit organisations who are ready to advance  their technology-based minimum viable product and build their start-up,  social impact and tech expertise.  This year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the program shifted from face-to- face delivery to a virtual model. Our finalists participated in online workshops  covering topics from marketing, purpose-driven innovation, designing for  social impact, product and tech development and pitch training. The program  culminated in a pitch night where the five Future Makers had the opportunity  to pitch for funding from a pool of $200,000. For a summary of the event,  refer to our media release. Our FY21 Future Makers: 	• Narelle Priestley (VIC) — AIBLE is a mobile recruitment platform  that matches people of all abilities with the right jobs, improving  workplace diversity and inclusion.  	• Frances Atkins (NSW) — givvable is a data-driven technology  platform that helps businesses find and track the impact of  sustainable and social spending. 	• Nitin Fernandez (NSW) — Maslow is a voice enabled assistant  to support carer and rehabilitation management for young  people with paralysis in their home.  	• Bronwyn Covill (VIC) — Need a Tutor improves education standards  and accessibility for those in remote locations through technology. 	• Clive Vaz (NSW) — PeepsRide enables organisations to provide  on-demand transport for those with a disability, the elderly  and dependents. Our 2020 Future Makers at the finale pitch event We take a shared value approach and continue to work with our alumni.  We have proudly supported the expansion of Virtualpsychologist into  the Philippines. As part of the Singtel Group Future Makers program,  we supported a pilot to expand Virtualpsychologist’s services to Globe  Telecom in the Philippines. The initiative called HopeChat is a 24/7 mental  consultation platform using Facebook Messenger, which allows over 8,000  Globe employees to chat with licensed psychologists. Offered at the height of  the community lockdowns in 2020, HopeChat was able to help the employees  address the stress and anxiety brought by the pandemic. The pilot has now  evolved into a full contract supporting Globe Telecom employees. 48 HOME Overview Helping People  Connect Protecting our  Environment Amazing  People Sustainable  Innovation HOME Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Governance  ===== PAGE 49 ===== eSIM innovation  Optus is the first mobile network provider in Australia to allow customers  to connect to a mobile network using an eSIM via an app on their phone.  An eSIM is an embedded SIM, where you can download a digital eSIM from  Optus and connect without a physical SIM card. We have done a preliminary  assessment of the benefits and have found the following:  Storytelling using AI  In 2020, we teamed up with immersive technology app provider Bookful  to allow children to step into their favourite books using augmented reality  (AR). The immersive experiences AR delivers is enhanced by the power and  speed of our 5G network and together can bring a wealth of opportunities  to consumers in many areas, particularly education.  Harnessing the power of  IoT and other technologies We remain committed to forming partnerships that align with our  commitment to sustainable innovation. Many of our partnerships leverage  Internet of Things (IoT) technology. IoT technology connects wearable  devices, environmental sensors and components in vehicles and buildings  together in harmony. Behind the IoT is Optus’ secure and reliable network  that enables the full potential of IoT to be harnessed. Across the year, we have entered into various partnerships with renowned  Australian universities to identify 5G opportunities to better address real- world industry challenges. These include: 	• Driving cyber security and data science innovation with the  University of South Australia (UniSA) to develop new products and  services and solve complex cyber issues, while educating Australia’s  next generation of cyber security and data science specialists; 	• Building an on-campus 5G lab with Curtin University for research,  teaching and learning, and collaboration to explore 5G applications  that benefit the Australian industry and economy with  Curtin University; 	• Advancing digital technology IoT Innovation with James Cook  University (JCU) across a range of industries; and 	• In June 2020, launching the National Industry Innovation Network  (NIIN) — an alliance between technology giant Cisco and La Trobe  and Curtin Universities — to improve Australia’s long-term digital  economic resilience by accelerating digital transformation. As  a start, a white paper on the role of collaborative technology in  remote working, with a specific focus on government, health and  education sectors will be developed to better analyse the adoption  and application of 5G technologies in different use cases.

We celebrated 30 years  of bringing Australians innovation  and choice, building Australia’s digital  infrastructure and contributing to a  stronger Australian economy.  We have been there for our people and our  customers in moments of crisis and we have  kept Australians connected through COVID-19,  enabling work-from-home, play-from-home,  and indeed everything-from-home!  In particular, FY22 saw Optus build upon our  strong history of sustainable business practices by  making significant progress across our six strategic  pillars, that are integral to the way we do business:  • Climate action  • Circular economy  • Digital enablement  • Sustainable innovation  • Future of work  • Equity and inclusion For each of these we have a set of targets that  reflect our ambitions for our business to 2025.  This report shares our progress towards achieving  them, the accomplishments and leadership role  we have played across social and environmental  areas, and the challenges we experienced. ^ L-R Paul O'Sullivan, Chairman, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, CEO and Ben White, MD Wholesale and Strategy  5  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Overview 6 Overview Connecting Protecting Empowering Enabling Innovating Governance Climate action Reducing our emissions During the year we’ve taken tangible steps  towards achieving our Net Zero by 2050 goal for  carbon emissions, making good progress on our  commitment to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and  2 emissions by 2030 using Science-Based Targets.  This year we also completed our first assessment  of our full Scope 3 emissions inventory, an initial  step in identifying how we can abate Scope 3  emissions from our supply chain activities.  Our priority is to reduce our operational emissions  while also increasing the proportion of our  electricity being backed by renewable sources.  In March 2022 we announced our commitment  to have 100% of our electricity consumption  backed by renewable energy sources by the  end of 2025. We have been using large-scale  generation certificates (LGCs), a tradeable form  of renewable energy, to support our emission  reduction efforts and in FY22 we surrendered  LGCs equivalent to 42GWh, allowing us to  reduce our net emissions by 8% over the year.  We hope to conclude our national renewable  energy tenders in 2022 for the remaining share of  electricity backed by renewable energy sources.  Also, following on our pilot for climate risk  related assessments, we completed a nationwide  assessment of our physical and transitional  risks in line with the recommendations of the  Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD).We are taking big action in this space! Sustainable innovation Linking our financing to sustainability To help us achieve our goals and allow our  investors to participate in our sustainability  journey, we tapped innovative sources of  finance, becoming the first telco in the Asia  Pacific to issue a Sustainability-Linked Bond  Framework. We then successfully issued a  A$300 million sustainability-linked bond (tied  to our emissions reduction commitments).  We know sustainability  matters to our customers We’re also partnering with our customers to  support them in reducing their environmental  impact in easy and simple ways. In May 2021,  we launched the Optus Living Network, a set of  on-demand features that give customers more  control and flexibility over their connectivity and  network experience through the My Optus App. Our latest Living Network feature, Optus  Eco, gives customers simple options to  reduce their environmental impact through  switching to paperless billing, donating their  device, opting for eSIMs, or even offsetting  some of their device and usage by supporting  local Australian carbon offset projects. Creating the  future of technology The Optus Living Network looks at going beyond  coverage and availability, to provide services such  as unlimited data days, Game Path (a service  that reduces lag and jitter for games) and Call  Translate. For more info see page 14 of this report.  This year we also launched a national 5G program  for organisations to explore, test and co-create  5G solutions with us. The program is provided  through our new 5G Innovation Hub in Sydney. Circular economy Our principles and roadmap We continued our commitment to circular  economy principles to reduce waste. Our Circular  Economy Roadmap, launched during the year,  sets out our pathway to achieve targets of 100%  recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by  2025 and ambitious goals to increase the amount  of Optus branded products with renewable or  recycled materials. We were recognized for the  fifth year running by the Australian Packaging  Covenant Organisation (APCO) receiving the  Industry Sector Award in Telecommunications  for our efforts toward sustainable packaging. Future of work Our supply chain efforts We’ve also progressed a range of initiatives  flowing from our modern slavery disclosures. We  published our second Modern Slavery Statement in  2022, and during the year we commenced a human  rights risk assessment to better understand our  business and supply chain risks. We have also  increased employee training on modern slavery.  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Overview 7 Overview Connecting Protecting Empowering Enabling Innovating Governance We would also like to acknowledge the great  contribution in time and talent made by our  people to continue to support a range of  community initiatives during the year. The pandemic made it challenging to undertake  initiatives requiring face to face contact, but the  enthusiasm of our people enabled us to continue  to support initiatives such as ABCN mentoring,  the KARI Foundation, and other programs. It’s these initiatives that show how our  social and environmental sustainability has  progressively become more integral to the  future of our business, driving transformation  and supporting our customers in their own lives.  With this year of achievement and innovation,  we face the future united as a team and full of  optimism for what we can achieve together. Regards, Paul O'Sullivan,  Chairman Kelly Bayer Rosmarin,  Chief Executive Officer Our amazing people Our amazing people are at the heart of Optus  and we are passionate about investing in our  people to empower them to fulfil their potential.  In February 2021 we introduced Optus U, our  micro-credential program in partnership with  leading universities to upskill our people in relevant  disciplines to drive our business to future success.   During this year, Optus U had its first full year of  operation and the feedback has been positive from  the 300 people who have undertaken courses. At the same time, we’re bolstering the pipeline  of women in leadership roles by introducing  in-house development programs designed to  support those moving into executive roles. And,  we announced a range of flexibility initiatives  including increased paid parental leave and  support for stillbirth and pregnancy loss, as well  as family and domestic violence entitlements. Equity and inclusion Our Diversity and Inclusion Senior Business  Forum was established to give focus and provide  advocacy in the delivery of Optus’ organisation- wide diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy.  As part of that approach, during the year we  launched five employee networks in support  of Women, Ability and Disability, Culture and  Heritage, LGBTQ+, and Veterans / Services  Personnel which provide the business with advice  and ensures these perspectives are incorporated  in our people and customer engagements. Recognising that it’s been (and remains  for some) a challenging time, we have also  placed additional emphasis on wellness in our  workplace health and safety, to promote good  mental and physical health in our people. Digital enablement Building a more inclusive digital world The restrictions in response to the pandemic and  resultant isolation amplified the need for digital  inclusion for all Australians, to enable connections  with friends and family, to complete studies and to  engage in modern society. We’re conscious of the  leadership role we continue to play in that regard  and the positive impact that we have had on more  than 27,000 vulnerable Australians who have  benefited from our Donate Your Data™ program. Donate Your Data™ was complemented in FY22  with the launch of Donate Your Device, a program  run in partnership with registered charity Good360  Australia Limited, enabling Optus customers to give  their spare phones to Australians in need. Donate  Your Data™ was also recognised by the Australian  Communications Industry Awards – the ACOMMS  – for innovation, and was highly commended in the  Shared Value Project of the Year Award for 2021. Our Donate Your Data™ and Digital Thumbprint  programs are going from strength to strength,  and we’ve expanded our scope for Donate Your  Data™ to provide connectivity for young people  and families in need, as well as people experiencing  crisis. Our crisis support provides six-months free  connectivity to vulnerable cohorts, such as people  experiencing homelessness, out of home care,  domestic and family violence, and impacts of  disaster. We also became a signatory to ‘The Telco  Industry Domestic and Family Violence Pledge’,  a collaborative and ongoing industry effort to  tackle domestic and family violence through the  Telco Together Foundation. We've also expanded  our Digital Thumbprint program, with interactive  digital workshops for primary school students.  ===== PAGE 8 ===== Overview 8 Overview Connecting Protecting Empowering Enabling Innovating Governance Sustainability Powering optimism with options for all Our 2025 targets Circular economy Future of work Equity and inclusion Sustainable innovation Climate action Digital enablement 100% recyclable, reusable or  compostable packaging Provide pathways to  employment for 5,000  disadvantaged youth Increase women  in leadership to 25% Zero major human  rights incidents in  our operations and  with major suppliers Commit 100% of our  electricity requirements to  be backed by renewable energy  sources by the end of 2025 Grow and scale five  impact innovations Support 550,000 young  people to participate  safely online 90% waste diversion  from landfill Connect 100,000  disadvantaged youth and  families to help close the  digital divide and support  Australians in crisis Reuse and recycle over  90% of our e-waste Harness the power of  volunteering to build the  knowledge and skills of  1,500 Optus people and  community leaders Formal future focused skills  development for 1,500 employees Reduce 25% of our absolute emissions  Strategy  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Overview 9 Overview Connecting Protecting Empowering Enabling Innovating Governance Overview Our 2025 Support 550,000  young people to  participate safely online Ensuring everyone has  all the tools they need  for positive, responsible  and authentic online  experiences Connect 100,000  disadvantaged youth  and families to help  close the digital divide  and support Australians  in crisis We believe everyone  deserves the chance  to reach their potential  and be supported in times  of crisis and disasters DIGITAL ENABLEMENT Provide pathways to  employment for 5,000  disadvantaged youth Supporting career  aspirations through  mentoring, skills transfer,  confidence building and  employment opportunities Increase women  in leadership to 25% Working to ensure gender  balanced leadership and  inspire our next generation  of leaders Zero major human rights  incidents in our operations  and with major suppliers Respecting the  human rights of people  wherever we operate EQUITY AND INCLUSION Grow and scale five  impact innovations Accelerating ground- breaking innovations  to address the most  pressing social and  environmental issues  of our time SUSTAINABLE  INNOVATION Reduce 25%  of our absolute  emissions Collaborate with  customers and partners  to reduce climate risk  and achieve the global  goal of no more than  1.5 degrees of warming Commit 100% of our  electricity requirements  to be backed by  renewable energy sources  by the end of 2025 Increasing the proportion  of our electricity backed  by renewable sources by  the end of 2025 CLIMATE ACTION Formal future focused  skills development for  1,500 employees Provide access to  accelerated advanced  learning to gain verified  recognition of critical  capabilities to thrive in an  ever-changing technology  enabled and digital world Harness the power of  volunteering to build the  knowledge and skills of  1,500 Optus people and  community leaders Fostering knowledge  transfer and developing  leadership and coaching  skills through volunteering,  probono, mentoring and  coaching programs FUTURE OF WORK 90% waste diversion  from landfill Reusing, recycling and  repurposing, keeping  everything in use as part  of the circular economy Reuse and recycle over  90% of our e-waste The more we give back,  the more we get back 100% recyclable, reusable  or compostable packaging Moving away from single- use materials, so nothing  is wasted CIRCULAR ECONOMY Targets Powering optimism with options for all Circular economy Future of work Equity and inclusion Sustainable innovation Climate action Digital enablement  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Overview 10 Overview Connecting Protecting Empowering Enabling Innovating Governance Published our  first TCFD report (Task Force on Climate-Related  Financial Disclosures) Won the Australian  Packaging Covenant  Organisation  (APCO) Industry  Sector Award in Telecommunications for efforts  toward sustainable packaging.

In FY22, we stepped up the pace of our network  improvements, to enable our customers to have  access to a fast and reliable service that enhances  the ability to connect with the world around them. 12  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Connecting 13 Connecting Overview Protecting Empowering Enabling Innovating Governance Putting our network first As a leading telecommunications  company, Optus plays a key role in  empowering customers and  the  community in the age of connectivity.  We continue to improve customer  experience while leveraging  partnerships to develop ambitious  new capabilities. Enhancing our 5G Network A fast and reliable network acts as a catalyst  for impactful innovation, powerful knowledge  sharing and meaningful personal connection, and  the reason why we are committed to building  Australia’s fastest 5G network. Our strong  performance has been recognised, with Optus  winning the Opensignal award for Australia's  fastest 5G mobile network for downloads.* This year, Optus also made further strides in  expanding the reach of our 5G network, which now  has over 1.5 million 5G-capable device customers.  In March 2022, we made 5G accessible to our  customers with compatible handsets in Hobart,  Tasmania, by leveraging the capabilities of our  technology partner, Ericsson.  Customers across Tasmania will soon have access,  with a further eight Optus 5G sites set to be  switched on by June 2022. Pioneering satellite technology  Optus makes sure that no one gets left behind in  the growing digital economy. We have directed  significant effort and resources to the delivery  of high-quality, reliable voice and data service  to rural and remote Australians. In FY22, we  launched a pilot program showcasing three  Optus Satellite services as part of the Australian  Federal Government’s Alternative Voice Services  Trial (AVST). Once deployed, Australians in rural  and remote areas will have access to mobile  services through satellites comparable in quality  to that of traditional copper wires. This will open  coverage beyond a fixed line socket in the home  to surrounding paddocks, and will give Australians  more options on how and where they connect.  Eliminating mobile  black spot sites  Optus has continued in its partnership with  the Australian Government through Round 5 of  the Mobile Black Spot Program. In FY22, Optus  switched on 57 new sites to connect our most  isolated communities. Since the Program’s  inception in 2015, Optus has delivered more than  205 new mobile base stations supported by $43.8  million in co-funding to improve connectivity across  Australia.

Optus  is committed to ensuring our network is strong,  resilient and able to provide additional support  to affected customers and communities in the  event of severe weather or natural disasters.  Here’s what we’ve done in FY22:   • Formed a partnership with Redflow  to deploy their battery system across  56 black spot sites under the Federal  Government’s Mobile Network Hardening  Program (MNHP) and Strengthening  Telecommunications Against Natural  Disasters (STAND) program. The batteries  will increase the resilience of our network,  particularly in bushfire-prone areas.  • Launched Yes! CPX (Critical Power  eXtender), a battery solution which can  assist transmission hubs in continuing  to operate for an extra 10 to 20 hours  following a failure of the main power grid.  This creates a buffer period for power  authorities to restore services or Optus  to access a site safely with a portable  generator, particularly where the area has  been impacted by extreme weather events.    • Implemented a Phase 4 upgrade to  Australia’s national emergency warning  system to keep Australians safe by  enabling access to real-time updates and  emergency warnings. The system now has  the capacity to reach over 500 emergency  service agencies across Australia and  will provide for more reliable and prompt  emergency messaging in the communities  that need it. Flood response The extensive floods that impacted New  South Wales and Queensland in 2022 have  further highlighted the importance of network  resilience for the safety of our customers and  wider community. Throughout the floods,  our overall network remained stable. Where  our towers were affected, we worked swiftly  to restore services with generators. We also  deployed our SATCATs to boost coverage in  targeted areas such as evacuation centres. Optus initiatives to support our impacted  communities and customers:  • Post-paid customers in affected areas  were provided with up to 25GB of  additional data to offset increased usage  on eligible plans   • Prepaid customers in affected areas were  provided with up to 25GB of additional  data on eligible plans   • Consumer and Business fixed internet  customers were eligible for a free interim  service to keep them connected  • Established a dedicated customer hotline  for those affected by the severe weather  • Donated $250,000 to the Red Cross QLD  and NSW Flood Appeal and launched staff  appeal with donations matched by Optus. ^ Optus SATCAT – a mobile base station that uses satellite  connection to provide temporary mobile coverage.  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Connecting 16 Connecting Overview Protecting Empowering Enabling Innovating Governance Bushfires We recognise that climate change has driven an  increase in the intensity of bushfires and length  of the bushfire season. That is why Optus is  taking proactive steps to improve early detection  and fires extinguishment. In response we have  developed meaningful partnerships to leverage  our capabilities and best protect our communities.  Here’s what we’re doing:  • CSIRO joint research: Optus has  collaborated with CSIRO to study the  potential impact of embers, radiation  and flame on and around Optus’  telecommunication sites. Findings have  identified sites that are most vulnerable  to future bushfire events and the best  way to protect them. These include adding  fire resistant filters to shelter cooling  inlets and replacing treated pine retaining  walls with concrete at sites. Trees close  to infrastructure are assessed to ensure  dead wood and surrounding debris are  removed. So far, Optus has implemented  these findings to make impactful upgrades  at two sites in Victoria. This has been  achieved alongside the development of in- house training and site assessment tools to  improve disaster response. In FY23, Optus  plans on continuing training and expanding  implementation of the findings as part of a  larger, longer-term resiliency program.  • Automated bushfire detection: We have  continued our partnership with the  Australian National University (ANU) and  Minderoo Foundation for the development  of a national bushfire Detect and Response  capability. The program will run until 2024.  • Fire management for threatened Sugar  Gliders: Optus has contributed $50,000  to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy  which will help support fire management  across native habitat and protect these  threatened species.  Cyclones We are enhancing network resilience throughout  cyclone-prone communities in North Queensland.  Across the nation, we have selected 125 sites to  receive either a power generator or be connected  to an existing essential power site to ensure  stable connectivity throughout power outages.  Generators have been installed at our first two  sites in North Queensland and have already  successfully stood the test of multiple power  outages, with the ability to start automatically  after detecting a mains power outage.

The TCFD  disclosures are structured around four  thematic areas: Governance, Strategy, Risk  Management, and Metrics & Targets. In FY22, as part of the Singtel Group, Optus  published its first report in alignment with the  TCFD framework, which can be found here.  As part of Optus’ inaugural TCFD report, we  expanded our initial pilot scenario analysis  completed in FY21 to the national level. In FY22,  we assessed over 7,000 network assets across  Australia against various climate scenarios. This  enabled us to determine the greatest physical  risks and exposure in terms of business continuity,  technical insurance premium analysis and  value risks for over 1,900 medium to higher risk  sites. Looking to the future, findings from this  exercise will allow us to better understand the  direct and indirect financial exposure to physical  risks, as well as prioritise where our adaptation  and mitigation efforts should be focused. We also assessed our risks in the transition to  a low carbon future. The financial materiality  assessment included the impact of possible  increases in carbon taxes, risk of stranded  capital assets from new energy or emissions  regulations, and exposure of our major  suppliers to similar policies and regulations.  Key climate action highlights  and progress in FY22  • Committed to 100% of our electricity  requirements to be backed by renewable  energy sources by the end of 2025  • Completed a full scope 3 emissions  inventory for all 15 categories for Australian  operations  • Completed Optus’ first full TCFD  disclosure, as part of Singtel Group’s  first standalone TCFD report  • Successfully concluded a A$300m  sustainability linked bond in Australia tied  to absolute emissions reductions  • Launched our first National Renewable  Energy tender    • Improved carbon emissions intensity from  0.08 tCO2e/TB in FY2021 to 0.06 tCO2e/TB  in FY2022  • Reduced absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions  428,458 tCO2e in FY21 to 394,253 tCO2e in  FY22 Tackling emissions Based on our TCFD analysis, the risks associated  with the transition to a low carbon future urgently  require greater and more transformative action,  particularly given the high emissions intensity of  the electricity grid and the growing energy demand  as we expand our network coverage and capacity.  As part of the Singtel Group, we remain committed  to reducing our absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by  42%, and scope 3 by 30% from our 2015 baseline  by 2030. We are also working toward net zero by  2050 in support of GSMA’s pathway for the ICT  and mobile industry. Our total emissions including  scope 3 in FY22 are estimated at 4,180,961 tCO2e.  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Protecting 20 Protecting Overview Connecting Empowering Enabling Innovating Governance Scope 3 emissions In FY22, we completed our first detailed  assessment of our full scope 3 emissions  inventory, as these sources make up the  majority of our total emissions. Purchased  goods and services (Category 1) and purchased  capital goods (Category 2) represent  around 86% of scope 3 emissions and our  greatest opportunity to collaborate with  suppliers towards our net zero goals. Renewable energy  strategy and approach We have accelerated the necessary shift  toward backing our electricity demand by  renewable energy sources. To do this, in March  2022, Optus made a commitment to having  100% of its electricity requirements backed by  renewable energy sources by the end of 2025.  Currently, electricity needed for our  operations is provided by the grid from a mix  of ‘green’, ‘brown’ and ‘black’ sources of power  generation. In FY22, this accounted for the  majority of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. To address this and work towards our emissions  targets in the short term, we will acquire  and surrender the equivalent of Large-Scale  Generation Certificates (LGCs) that are linked  to the generation of renewable energy in  Australia. In FY22, LGCs enabled us to reduce  our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 8% from FY21  levels. In the longer term (by end 2025 and  beyond), our aim is to have a significant portion  of such LGCs tied to renewable energy power  purchasing agreements (REPPA), which we may  contract directly with renewable energy projects  and/or through intermediary energy retailers  that supply our broader electricity needs. We expect to see a portion of our emissions  reduction from electricity usage to come from  ‘unbundled’ LGCs generated from existing  operational renewable energy projects where we  have no direct or indirect contractual relationship.  Such unbundled LGCs may be sourced through  energy retailers or through LGC wholesale  markets. This mix of unbundled LGCs will be  higher in the initial years leading up to 2025 as  renewable energy projects take time to develop.  Source: Scope 3 Emissions mitigation modelling  results deck prepared by EDGE. We note that our actual electricity usage may  vary from year to year, and we anticipate that  there may be locations and states where our  demand is not sufficiently large enough to  undertake REPPA contracts. This means that  while we aim to reduce our use of LGCs, we  expect them to continue to be an ongoing but  reducing source for our emission reduction needs. Sustainability-linked bonds During the year, we made history by being the  first telco in Asia Pacific to issue a sustainability- linked bond (SLB) which was tied to Optus’  emissions reduction commitments. Optus,  through its wholly owned subsidiary, Optus  Finance, raised a A$300m 7-year fixed-rate  note carrying a coupon of 2.60% per annum,  maturing on 24 November 2028. There was  strong demand for Optus’ inaugural SLB issuance  from the investor community, and we are highly  encouraged that our efforts to link financing  to sustainability has been well received.  9.4% 90.6% Scope 1 & 2 Scope 3  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Protecting 21 Protecting Overview Connecting Empowering Enabling Innovating Governance Optus Eco We have recently launched Optus Eco as  an additional feature as part of our Living  Network.

We are also committed to continuous  improvement and are working hard to remove  single use plastics from packaging design and  enhance the uptake of Australasian Recycling  Label (ARL) to reduce recycling confusion. In 2021 371 t of Optus' packaging  components had  at least some  packaging that  is made from  recycled material.  108 t of Optus' packaging  had separable  components with  mixed recoverability  at end-of-life.  68 t of Optus' packaging  was not recoverable  at end-of-life and  must go to landfill. In FY23, Optus will  focus on significantly  decreasing this  number in alignment  with our Circular  Economy Roadmap. 433 t of Optus' packaging  had all packaging  components that  were recoverable  (recyclable or  compostable at  end-of-life).  172 t of Optus' packaging  components had  packaging for which  all components  are reusable. ^ Our 2021 APCO Industry Sector award in Telecommunications 22  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Protecting 23 Protecting Overview Connecting Empowering Enabling Innovating Governance Supplier engagement We are working with suppliers across  the environmental and social aspects  of the supply chain to promote product  stewardship and sustainable packaging. Reinforcing our commitment to a sustainable  supply chain, Optus has updated our supplier  code of conduct to include considerations for  our sustainable packaging goals. The code of  conduct is applicable to our suppliers and includes  mandatory requirements for suppliers to provide  information on materials used in packaging. There are also requirements for suppliers to  take steps toward eliminating single use plastic,  and increasing recycled content in packaging to  align with Optus' Circular Economy targets.

MobileMuster Optus is a founding member of MobileMuster,  which is a national recycling program for  the mobile phone industry. Over the past  25 years, Optus has proudly supported  MobileMuster to keep mobile phones out of  landfill by hosting collection points in retail  stores and including reply paid recycling  satchels in Optus pre-paid mobile bundles. E-waste In FY22, Optus made significant progress  toward its 2025 target to reuse and recycle  over 90% of our e-waste. We achieved 100%  diversion from landfill in IT and 97% diversion  in Networks. We also increased our e-waste  collection by 62% in FY22 as part of the Mobile  Muster program, when compared against FY21. General waste During FY22, we deployed new colour coded bins  to facilitate waste segregation, supported by  easy-to-understand visuals and communications  across our Sydney campus, with a view to  roll them out nationally in FY23. However,  Optus diverted only 20% of its general waste  from landfill and we recognise that more  needs to be done to achieve our 2025 target  of 90% waste diversion from landfill. 23  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Empowering Our People People are at the heart of Optus, and do all we  can through our purpose to 'power optimism  with options for all’.

KARI Scholarship program  In FY22, our KARI Scholarship program provided  financial and mentoring support to 20 Indigenous  students entering their final years of high school.  The scholarship covered educational-related  expenses for students including excursions, books  and materials. While the mentoring component  of the program was unable to proceed to  its fullest capacity due to the pandemic, our  Optus employees still connected with their  students through a video sharing messages of  encouragement.  NAIDOC week  To celebrate NAIDOC week, Optus hosted Tranby  National Indigenous Adult Education and Training to  share on the purpose and meaning behind Welcome  and Acknowledgement of Country. Over 500 of  our amazing people joined to gain insights into our  Indigenous heritage, and what acknowledgement  means to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous  communities. The powerful close to the session  was to keep the conversation going, to research  the lands on which you live, and create your own  acknowledgement. 30  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Empowering 31 Empowering Overview Connecting Protecting Enabling Innovating Governance Prioritising health,  safety and wellbeing Optus puts the health, safety and wellbeing of our  people, communities and workplaces first.  Health and safety In FY22, we improved our performance in  preventing workplace-related injuries. Our  workplace injury frequency rate was 0.65, (down  from 1.5 in FY21). Our workplace fatality rate  remained at 0 in FY22, and the absenteeism rate  was 0.02. We continue to maintain our certification of  AS4801, the Australian Standard for Safety  Management.  We also successfully passed the audit by Lloyds  Register for our certification ISO 45001, the  International Standard for Safety Management  in April 2022 and the Office of the Federal Safety  Commissioner in February 2022.  These audits  confirmed our compliance with the regulatory  expectations associated with the use of   Australian Federal Government funding.

Along the way, they were provided study  leave, access to coaches and business sponsors. Talent ambassador program  Optus has tapped into social media as a powerful  tool for attracting and retaining the next wave  of top Optus talent. Our Talent Ambassador  Program harnesses the power of social media  and elevates the voices of Optus people through  the #OptusLife hashtag. In FY22, we aimed to  grow the program further. We received nearly  100 applications and chose a diverse group of  40 ambassadors, increasing our cohort to 120  ambassadors – our biggest yet. Throughout  the year, our ambassadors were provided with  tailored training and networking opportunities  to amplify their personal brand and social  media marketing skills. This included sessions  run by LinkedIn and the Optus Brand Team.   Since its launch in 2019, the program has:   • Generated over 2.4 million organic views  from #OptusLife posts  • Seen over 100,000 likes and 10,000  comments from ambassador posts  • Saved over $300,000 in advertising costs  • Driven engagement in company-driven  content, increasing the Optus LinkedIn  page followers to over 123,000 Ensuring a responsible  supply chain At Optus, sustainability flows through our  operations and into our supply chain. We have  embedded environmental and social considerations  into the way we select and work with our suppliers. Human rights and  modern slavery  Optus is committed to protecting and respecting  human rights across our operations and our  supply chain by acting with integrity, trust  and transparency. In FY22, we published our  second Modern Slavery statement which  provides details on our approach and progress  on mitigating modern slavery risks. Our current focus includes undertaking a  risk assessment of our major suppliers and  integrating the plan into our Whistleblower  hotline. These actions will strengthen our current  approach to modern slavery, which includes  supplier questionnaires to inform our modern  slavery risk management and training. In our  last reporting period, over 95% of Optus people  leaders completed the online training modules.2 Indigenous suppliers Optus continues to partner with Supply  Nation, a not-for-profit that connects large  companies across Australia and Indigenous  Australian businesses. We now have access  to over 3000 certified Indigenous suppliers  whom we seek to engage for services. 2This figure is correct as at September 2021  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Empowering 35 Empowering Overview Connecting Protecting Enabling Innovating Governance While we continued to support a wide  range of community initiatives, the  ongoing impact of COVID-19 meant  that the majority of our volunteering  programs were unable to run in FY22  because they were based on face-to- face interactions.  Despite the challenges, many of our people  contributed time and talent during the  year to support a range of causes. Our  ABCN programs still managed to reach  over 2,000 students through our mentoring  programs and ABCN Connects videos. The Agile tribe launched a workshop aimed at  upskilling charity partners in the Agile ways of  working. With 10 charities represented across  three sessions, the workshops offered great tools  and a framework to help implement new  projects and fundraising campaigns. Three of our amazing people also committed  to raising $10,000 each to support 2018  Optus Future Makers finalist, the StandByU  Foundation. Our NSW team focused on digital  fundraising, online trivia, and raffles. While  our QLD cohort raised over $87,000 at the  inaugural Glitz and Glam Gala Dinner. Supporting our community Continuing the theme of adapting to the  environment, over 900 of our amazing people  ‘stepped up’ for the Cerebral Palsy Alliance,  STEPtember event, collectively raising  over $75,000.

The Women in STEM  Breakfast event featured a few of our people,  including Shanti Berggren providing a keynote  address, and Chris Lynch and Shreya Abhyankar  sharing on the panel. It was a wonderful  opportunity to sow inspiration into the next  generation of students to pursue careers in STEM. When face-to-face activations were permitted,  Optus hosted Royal Far West for a great hands  on activation day, running the Mr Fuzzy workshops. These workshops are both insightful and creative.  Assembled volunteers learn about the gap between  our urban and regional and rural healthcare  systems and disparate access to specialists. Then,  to assist Occupational Therapists in the field, our  teams created works of art, repurposing tennis  balls to become therapy tools to improve fine  motor skills for children in remote and rural areas. Optus also hosted a number of major fundraising  campaigns over the financial year including our  rapid response to the Indian COVID situation. Our  amazing people raised over $17,000 in support of  CARE Australia to reach some of the most remote  areas of India, where temporary hospitals were set  up, equipped with medical staff and medication,  and personal protective equipment provided. We continued our support for The Pyjama  Foundation by participating in the annual National  Pyjama Day fundraiser. Together we raised  over $4,000 to support children in foster care.  The fundraiser was a great success and brought  teams from across the country together, wearing  their pyjamas for a great cause. We were able  to raise awareness of The Pyjama Foundation   and the great work they do, supporting and  mentoring children in foster care through the  Pyjama Angels program. For our annual Christmas appeal we supported  the charity, Magic Moments, (AKA Basket  Brigades), to raise funds for families doing it  tough. Our teams rallied together and raised over  $16,500 and donated toys including thousands  of our exclusive edition Hot Wheels Optus cars. We continued our longstanding support of the  NELUNE Foundation, a charity that provides  psychological and practical support, assistance  and care for public hospital and underprivileged  cancer patients of all ages. The Foundation  has established two cancer treatment centres  in Darlinghurst and Randwick. Our support is  dedicated to wholly funding the provision of two  patient transport vehicles to help transport cancer  patients to and from appointments. In FY22, Optus  donated over $290,000 to help provide practical  and tangible support for cancer patients receiving  treatment in the NSW public hospital service. 3Our community investment includes our charitable  contributions, such as cash donations, in-kind and time  and our leveraged and foregone revenue contributions.

With generous  customer donations and the support of a range  of charity partners, Optus harnesses the power  of collaboration to ensure data gets to where  it’s needed most. The program launched in 2019  with support for young people and has already  expanded significantly to now include support  for families and people experiencing crisis.  The Donate Your DataTM program was a  key discussion point of our inaugural Digital  Inclusion Roundtable held on 5 April 2021.  The overall theme was how Optus can better  empower vulnerable and disadvantaged  Australians to thrive in the digital world.  Agreed priority areas included:   • supporting additional cohorts and  providing crisis support  • access to devices  • how to better support and engage  vulnerable people Since the Roundtable, we have expanded  Donate Your DataTM cohorts to now include  families, and also introduced a Crisis SIM  that provides six-month SIM plans to people  experiencing homelessness, out of home care,  domestic and family violence and impacts  of disaster. Our Customer Experience team  is also working across Optus to better  understand how we better support vulnerable  customers. This project will continue in FY23. Domestic and family violence sadly spiked during  COVID, and while a device can provide a means  to seek help, it can also be a tool for control and  abuse. Optus supports an industry-wide approach  to supporting victim-survivors and became a  signatory to ‘The Telco Industry Domestic and  Family Violence Pledge’.

That’s  why we have launched our Donate Your Device  program. With the support of our customers  and partners, the program will provide eligible  preloved mobile devices to those who need them  most. The donated handsets will be provided  with a Donate Your DataTM SIM, which includes  data, calls and text, plus additional data donated  by customers through our Donate Your DataTM  program (disclaimer: Optus Fair Go Policy applies). Online safety This year we are proud to once again support  Safer Internet Day with the theme ‘Play it  Fair Online’. On the day, Optus ran free Digital  Thumbprint workshops in schools across Australia  including regional locations. We also had Optus  Ambassador, Chaz Mostert, reaching out to  Australians to share his personal message to  encourage kids and parents to think about the  effects of their actions and play it fair online. The  Bathurst 2021 winner is a passionate advocate of  online safety, he has experienced trolling firsthand  and seen the negative effects on fellow drivers. We  will continue to work with Chaz, as a role model, on  other online safety initiatives throughout the year.  Digital Thumbprint program The education landscape has shifted in response to  COVID-19 and redefined the way that Australian  students interact with their educators and  peers.  The sudden, and in some cases sustained,  disruption to school life brought new challenges  and amplified existing ones for teachers and their  students, most notably a significant increase  in time spent online.  To respond to this new  reality, Digital Thumbprint has transitioned  into an enhanced digital delivery model, with  virtual facilitator-led delivery and teacher-led  digital interactive workshops.  This blended  delivery model enabled us to educate 80,260  young people this financial year and ensures  that teachers and students across Australia can  remain connected to critical digital education.   Since 2013, our award-winning Optus Digital  Thumbprint program has reached 471,524   Australian primary and secondary students. The  program is endorsed by the eSafety Commissioner  as a Trusted eSafety Provider. Digital Thumbprint  provides free, curriculum-aligned workshops  across five topics delivered by one of our  facilitators, or by teachers with our interactive  digital platform. We expanded teacher-led  delivery this year with new workshops for primary  school, Grades 3-4. These gamified workshops  offer students badges for correct answers, and  completion. Current topics are ‘Staying Safe  on Apps and Games’ and ‘Keeping Information  Safe Online’.  New topics are launching in FY23.    ===== PAGE 41 ===== Innovating our Digital Future We’re all about creating the future we want  through innovation and leading technology.

In FY22, we launched  our national 5G Innovation Program to empower  enterprise, SMBs and start-ups in an environment  to identify, test and explore future-state 5G use  cases. We explore how they can apply to business,  government and community life today and in the  years to come. The program is powered by Optus’  newest 5G Innovation Hub, which is an innovation  space for over 500 start-ups based in Sydney. The program has three core principles:  Concurrent 5G and 4G services Optus has deployed the first high capacity triple- band 4G/5G Radio in the Asia Pacific region in  collaboration with Ericsson as Optus ramps up  its site deployment program. The new technology,  developed in partnership with Ericsson, will allow  Optus to deploy concurrent 5G and 4G services  across 1800MHz, 2100MHz and 2600MHz  spectrum layers via a single radio unit. This  reduces the amount of equipment required at  each site, overcoming issues with limited space  or lease terms at sites requiring upgrades. Project Endeavour The Optus network is set to power 5G drone  technology that will enhance electrical grid  reliability and worker safety during fires and  floods. The $648,000 project funded through  the Federal Government’s 5G innovation  initiative brings together the Optus 5G network,  Amazon Web Service’s cloud technology and  Unleash Live’s artificial intelligence, drone  technology and ultra high-definition cameras  to monitor Endeavour Energy’s network. Endeavour Energy supplies power to more than 2.6  million people in New South Wales, with a network  made up of over 60,000 powerlines, 400,000  power poles and 32,000 substations. The network  is currently monitored via on-site inspections  conducted by a team of technicians who rely  on a large fleet of vehicles and helicopters. The new project will enable Endeavour to  remotely monitor the network via live-streamed  drone footage. This technology will enhance  resource efficiency, accelerate network  remediation and improve worker safety.   In April 2022, the first drone trial was conducted  outside of Sydney, with footage streamed to  Endeavour Energy’s training ground using Optus’  5G network. The next step is to deploy the drone  solution in select NSW sites, enhancing Australia’s  position as a leader when it comes to improving  grid reliability and reducing the risks associated  to wildfires, floods and other public hazards.

We were also recognised as Service  Champions in the Service Transformation  category for our commitment to  leveraging automation, robust capability  planning and evolving our digital  capabilities to better serve customers. Optus Future Makers The Optus Future Makers is a six-month accelerator  program for social impact start-ups who leverage  technology. The program runs every two years and  aims to empower participating start-ups with  the investment required to scale their business  and their impact for social good. In FY22, Optus  continued to work closely with our 2020 Future  Makers, exploring ways to work together. Through  Optus’ partnership with Vogue Codes Australia,  we were able to feature one of our 2020 Future  Makers, Need A Tutor, as part of the annual Vogue  Codes Country virtual event. Paying particular  attention to rural and regional entrepreneurs,  speakers talked about their own business journeys  (challenges and all), to the rewarding experience  that building a business wherever you live can be. The event’s objective is to provide a  platform for young women to engage  with and be inspired by women who are  influencing the tech landscape globally.  We also embarked on a pilot with 2020 Future  Maker, givvable, to better understand the  sustainability impacts of our suppliers. givvable  is a start-up using an AI-powered supplier  sustainability intelligence platform to help  companies enable better decision making and  ease sustainability reporting requirements. Three of our 2020 Optus Future Makers – givvable,  Maslow and AIBLE also participated in the Singtel  Group Future Makers program in 2021, and had the  opportunity to showcase their solutions across the  Asia Pacific region with our associates in Thailand,  Indonesia, India, Philippines and Singapore. eSIM Optus was the first mobile network provider in  Australia to allow customers to connect to a mobile  network using an eSIM via an app on their phone.  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Governance 45  ===== PAGE 46 ===== Governance 46 Governance Overview Connecting Protecting Empowering Enabling Innovating For our customers  The privacy and security of our customer data  is paramount at Optus. Our Privacy Policy sets  out strict procedures that govern the handling  and protection of sensitive customer data. In FY22, our privacy incident response  plan was reviewed to ensure that our  ability to respond to major incidents was  robust. No updates were required. We continue to record customer privacy  complaints that are referred to us from our  customers, staff, other individuals or regulatory  bodies. In FY22, there were 130 customer data  complaints that have been categorised as privacy  incidents. Of this, four cases were referred by  the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman  (TIO), and one case from the Office of the  Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). The  threshold to notify the Office of the Australian  Information Commissioner was met on one  occasion out of these complaints during FY22,  and therefore one Notifiable Data Breach was  notified to the OAIC from Optus for this period. In FY22, Optus did not receive any fines  from either the Australian Competition  and Consumer Commission (ACCC) or the  Australian Communications and Media  Authority (ACMA). In FY22, the ACMA issued  three non-monetary sanctions: a formal  warning to conduct identify verification prior to  porting mobile services; a direction to comply  with billing accuracy obligations under the  Telecommunications Consumer Protection  Code; and a remedial direction to undertake  line capability testing on NBN lines. Tax contributions  and transparency As one of Australia’s Top 100 public taxpayers,  Optus recognises that our contributions help  communities by financing the government  activities that support a range of important social  initiatives. We know tax transparency improves  the community’s confidence in the corporate  sector. As a signatory to the Board of Taxation’s  voluntary tax transparency code, we’ve published  Tax Transparency Reports since FY18.
